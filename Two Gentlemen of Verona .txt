cease to persuade my loving proteus homekeeping youth have ever homely wits weret not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honourd love i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad than living dully sluggardized at home wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness but since thou lovest love still and thrive therein even as i would when i to love begin and on a lovebook pray for my success thats on some shallow story of deep love how young leander crossd the hellespont tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swum the hellespont no i will not for it boots thee not to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moments mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labour won however but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquished so by your circumstance i fear youll prove love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender wit is turnd to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee that art a votary to fond desire once more adieu my father at the road expects my coming there to see me shippd sweet proteus no now let us take our leave to milan let me hear from thee by letters of thy success in love and what news else betideth here in absence of thy friend and likewise will visit thee with mine as much to you at home and so farewell not mine my gloves are on ha let me see ay give it me its mine

son that well deserves the honour and regard of such a father i know him as myself for from our infancy we have conversed and spent our hours together and though myself have been an idle truant omitting the sweet benefit of time to clothe mine age with angellike perfection yet hath sir proteus for thats his name made use and fair advantage of his days his years but young but his experience old his head unmellowd but his judgment ripe and in a word for far behind his worth comes all the praises that i now bestow he is complete in feature and in mind with all good grace to grace a gentleman should i have wishd a thing it had been he this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me but that his mistress did hold his eyes lockd in her crystal looks nay sure i

imperious thoughts have punishd me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs for in revenge of my contempt of love love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes and made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow o gentle proteus loves a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love even she and is she not a heavenly saint call her divine o flatter me for love delights in praises then speak the truth by her if not divine yet let her be a principality sovereign to all the creatures on the earth sweet except not any except thou wilt except against my love and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honour to bear my ladys train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favour growing proud disdain to root the summerswelling flower and make rough winter everlastingly pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone not for the world why man she is mine own and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl the water nectar and the rocks pure gold forgive me that i do not dream on thee because thou seest me dote upon my love my foolish rival that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge is gone with her along and i must after for love thou knowst is full of jealousy ay and we are betrothd nay more our marriagehour with all the cunning manner of our flight determined of how i must climb her window the ladder made of cords and all the means plotted and greed on for my happiness good proteus go with me to my chamber in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel will you make haste please it your grace there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends and i am going to deliver them the tenor of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honourable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter cannot your grace win her to fancy him what would your grace have me to do in this win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a womans mind a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her send her another never give her oer for scorn at first makes afterlove the more if she do frown tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide tis not to have you gone for why the fools are mad if left alone take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away flatter and praise commend extol their graces though neer so black say they have angels faces that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman why then i would resort to her by night what lets but one may enter at her window why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks would serve to scale another heros tower so bold leander would adventure it when would you use it pray sir tell me that by seven oclock ill get you such a ladder it will be light my lord that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length ay my good lord why any cloak will serve the turn my lord and why not death rather than living torment to die is to be banishd from myself and silvia is myself banishd from her is self from self a deadly banishment what light is light if silvia be not seen what joy is joy if silvia be not by unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by silvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on silvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon she is my essence and i leave to be if i be not by her fair influence fosterd illumined cherishd kept alive i fly not death to fly his deadly doom tarry i here i but attend on death but fly i hence i fly away from life no neither nothing my ears are stopt and cannot hear good news so much of bad already hath possessd them is silvia dead no valentine indeed for sacred silvia hath she forsworn me no valentine if silvia have forsworn me what is your news o i have fed upon this woe already and now excess of it will make me surfeit doth silvia know that i am banished no more unless the next word that thou speakst have some malignant power upon my life if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear as ending anthem of my endless dolour i pray thee launce an if thou seest my boy bid him make haste and meet me at the northgate o my dear silvia hapless valentine my friends then know that i have little wealth to lose a man i am crossd with adversity my riches are these poor habiliments of which if

youthful travel therein made me happy or else i often had been miserable peace villain nothing but my fortune i take your offer and will live with you provided that you do no outrages on silly women or poor passengers how use doth breed a habit in a man this shadowy desert unfrequented woods i better brook than flourishing peopled towns here can i sit alone unseen of any and to the nightingales

what it was repair me with thy presence silvia thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain what halloing and what stir is this today these are my mates that make their wills their law have some unhappy passenger in chase they love me well yet i have much to do to keep them from uncivil outrages withdraw thee valentine whos this comes here aside  how like a dream is this i see and hear love

bosom proteus i am sorry i must never trust thee more but count the world a stranger for thy sake the private wound is deepest o time most accurst mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst then i am paid and once again i do receive thee honest who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleased by penitence the eternals wraths appeased and that my love may appear plain and free all that was mine in silvia i give thee why boy why wag how now whats the matter look up speak come come a hand from either let me be blest to make this happy close twere pity two such friends should be long foes forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke your grace is welcome to a man disgraced banished valentine thurio give back or else embrace thy death come not

your grace the gift hath made me happy i now beseech you for your daughters sake to grant one boom that i shall ask of you these banishd men that i have kept withal are men endued with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recalld from their exile they are reformed civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord and as we walk along i dare

environ thee commend thy grievance to my holy prayers for i will be thy beadsman valentine upon some book i love ill pray for thee thats a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love over the boots nay give me not the boots what so by your circumstance you call me fool tis love you cavil at i am not love yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all and thither will i bring thee valentine all happiness bechance to thee in milan he after honour hunts i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more i leave myself my friends and all for love thou julia thou hast metamorphosed me made me neglect my studies lose my time war with good counsel set the world at nought made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought but now he parted hence to embark for milan indeed a sheep doth very often stray an if the shepherd be a while away i do a silly answer and fitting well a sheep true and thy master a shepherd it shall go hard but ill prove it by another the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep but dost thou hear gavest thou my letter to julia heres too small a pasture for such store of muttons nay in that you are astray twere best pound you you mistake i mean the pounda pinfold but what said she nodaywhy thats noddy and that set together is noddy no no you shall have it for bearing the letter why sir how do you bear with me beshrew me but you have a quick wit come come open the matter in brief what said she well sir here is for your pains what said she why couldst thou perceive so much from her what said she nothing go go be gone to save your ship from wreck which cannot perish having thee aboard being destined to a drier death on shore   i must go send some better messenger i fear my julia would not deign my lines receiving them from such a worthless post sweet love sweet lines sweet life here is her hand the agent of her heart here is her oath for love her honours pawn o that our fathers would applaud our loves to seal our happiness with their consents o heavenly julia mayt please your lordship tis a word or two of commendations sent from valentine deliverd by a friend that came from him there is no news my lord but that he writes how happily he lives how well beloved and daily graced by the emperor wishing me with him partner of his fortune as one relying on your lordships will and not depending on his friendly wish my lord i cannot be so soon provided please you deliberate a day or two thus have i shunnd the fire for fear of burning and drenchd me in the sea where i am drownd i feard to show my father julias letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by and by a cloud takes all away why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no have patience gentle julia when possibly i can i will return why then well make exchange here take you this here is my hand for my true constancy and when that hour oerslips me in the day wherein i sigh not julia for thy sake the next ensuing hour some foul mischance torment me for my loves forgetfulness my father stays my coming answer not the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears that tide will stay me longer than i should julia farewell   what gone without a word ay so true love should do it cannot speak for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it go i come i come alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb not so sweet  lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress my duty will i boast of nothing else ill die on him that says so but yourself that you are worthless well both attend upon your ladyship your friends are well and have them much commended i left them all in health my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse enough i read your fortune in your eye was this the idol that you worship so no but she is an earthly paragon i will not flatter her when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you except my mistress have i not reason to prefer mine own why valentine what braggardism is this then let her alone but she loves you go on before i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then ill presently attend you i will   even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten is it mine or valentines praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus she is fair and so is julia that i love that i did love for now my love is thawd which like a waxen image gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont o but i love his lady too too much and thats the reason i love him so little how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reasons light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind if i can cheque my erring love i will if not to compass her ill use my skill to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and even that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear o sweetsuggesting love if thou hast sinned teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolved will to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferrd with twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia silvia i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and silviawitness heaven that made her fair shows julia but a swarthy ethiope i will forget that julia is alive remembering that my love to her is dead and valentine ill hold an enemy aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery used to valentine this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial silvias chamberwindow myself in counsel his competitor now presently ill give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enraged will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone ill quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurios dull proceeding love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favours done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stoln away from you it would be much vexation to your age thus for my dutys sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave know noble lord they have devised a mean how he her chamberwindow will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimed at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretence adieu my lord sir valentine is coming run boy run run and seek him out what seest thou valentine who then his spirit what then who wouldst thou strike villain forbear sirrah i say forbear friend valentine a word then in dumb silence will i bury mine for they are harsh untuneable and bad no valentine no valentine that thou art banishedo thats the news from hence from silvia and from me thy friend ay ay and she hath offerd to the doom which unreversed stands in effectual force a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her fathers churlish feet she tenderd with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they waxed pale for woe but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be taen must die besides her intercession chafed him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lamentst time is the nurse and breeder of all good here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life hope is a lovers staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be deliverd even in the milkwhite bosom of thy love the time now serves not to expostulate come ill convey thee through the citygate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy loveaffairs as thou lovest silvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me go sirrah find him out come valentine gone my good lord a little time my lord will kill that grief longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace i do my lord she did my lord when valentine was here the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend you have prevaild my lord if i can do it by ought that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio as much as i can do i will effect but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be fullfraught with serviceable vows say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands after your direlamenting elegies visit by night your ladys chamberwindow with some sweet concert to their instruments tune a deploring dump the nights dead silence will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance this or else nothing will inherit her well wait upon your grace till after supper and afterward determine our proceedings already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio under the colour of commending him i have access my own love to prefer but silvia is too fair too true too holy to be corrupted with my worthless gifts when i protest true loyalty to her she twits me with my falsehood to my friend when to her beauty i commend my vows she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i loved and notwithstanding all her sudden quips the least whereof would quell a lovers hope yet spaniellike the more she spurns my love the more it grows and fawneth on her still but here comes thurio now must we to her window and give some evening music to her ear ay gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in service where it cannot go sir but i do or else i would be hence ay silvia for your sake sir thurio fear not you i will so plead that you shall say my cunning drift excels at saint gregorys well madam good even to your ladyship one lady if you knew his pure hearts truth you would quickly learn to know him by his voice sir proteus gentle lady and your servant that i may compass yours i grant sweet love that i did love a lady but she is dead i likewise hear that valentine is dead sweet lady let me rake it from the earth madam if your heart be so obdurate vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love the picture that is hanging in your chamber to that ill speak to that ill sigh and weep for since the substance of your perfect self is else devoted i am but a shadow and to your shadow will i make true love as wretches have oernight that wait for execution in the morn sebastian is thy name i like thee well and will employ thee in some service presently i hope thou wilt   how now you whoreson peasant where have you been these two days loitering and what says she to my little jewel but she received my dog what didst thou offer her this from me go get thee hence and find my dog again or neer return again into my sight away i say stayst thou to vex me here   a slave that still an end turns me to shame sebastian i have entertained thee partly that i have need of such a youth that can with some discretion do my business for tis no trusting to yond foolish lout but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior which if my augury deceive me not witness good bringing up fortune and truth therefore know thou for this i entertain thee go presently and take this ring with thee deliver it to madam silvia she loved me well deliverd it to me not so i think she lives why dost thou cry alas wherefore shouldst thou pity her well give her that ring and therewithal this letter thats her chamber tell my lady i claim the promise for her heavenly picture your message done hie home unto my chamber where thou shalt find me sad and solitary o sir i find her milder than she was and yet she takes exceptions at your person no that it is too little she says it is a fair one but pearls are fair and the old saying is black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes ill when you talk of war o sir she makes no doubt of that that you are well derived o ay and pities them that they are out by lease nor i neither and i will follow more for silvias love than hate of eglamour that goes with her madam this service i have done for you though you respect not aught your servant doth to hazard life and rescue you from him that would have forced your honour and your love vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look a smaller boon than this i cannot beg and less than this i am sure you cannot give unhappy were you madam ere i came but by my coming i have made you happy what dangerous action stood it next to death would i not

valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence i tender t here i do as truly suffer as eer i did commit look to the boy where is that ring boy how let me see why this is the ring i gave to julia but how camest thou by this ring at my depart i gave this unto julia how julia than men their minds tis true o heaven were man but constant he were perfect that one error fills him with faults makes him run through all the sins inconstancy falls off ere it begins what is in silvias face but i may spy more fresh in julias with a constant eye bear witness heaven i have my wish for eversir proteus save you saw you my master twenty to one then he is shippd already and i have playd the sheep in losing him you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and i a sheep why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep this proves me still a sheep nay that i can deny by a circumstance the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep such another proof will make me cry baa ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a laced mutton and she a laced mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labour if the ground be overcharged you were best stick her nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter from a pound to a pin fold it over and over tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover first nodding  ay you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and i say ay now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your pains well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word noddy for my pains and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse open your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered truly sir i think youll hardly win her sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind i fear shell prove as hard to you in telling your mind give her no token but stones for shes as hard as steel no not so much as take this for thy pains to testify your bounty i thank you you have testerned me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir ill commend you to my master sir your glove why then this may be yours for this is but one madam silvia madam silvia she is not within hearing sir your worship sir or else i mistook and yet i was last chidden for being too slow she that your worship loves marry by these special marks first you have learned like sir proteus to wreathe your arms like a malecontent to relish a lovesong like a robinredbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his a b c to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas you were wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walked to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you looked sadly it was for want of money and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress that when i look on you i can hardly think you my master they are all perceived without ye without you nay thats certain for without you were so simple none else would but you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper why sir i know her not is she not hardfavoured sir sir i know that well enough that she is not so fair as of you wellfavoured thats because the one is painted and the other out of all count marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts of her beauty you never saw her since she was deformed ever since you loved her if you love her you cannot see her because love is blind o that you had mine eyes or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at sir proteus for going ungartered your own present folly and her passing deformity for he being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose true sir i was in love with my bed i thank you you swinged me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours i would you were set so your affection would cease and have you are they not lamely writ aside  o excellent motion o exceeding puppet now will he interpret to her aside  o give ye good even heres a million of manners aside  he should give her interest and she gives it him aside  and yet you will and yet another yet o jest unseen inscrutable invisible as a nose on a mans face or a weathercock on a steeple my master sues to her and she hath taught her suitor he being her pupil to become her tutor o excellent device was there ever heard a better that my master being scribe to himself should write the letter nay i was rhyming tis you that have the reason to be a spokesman for madam silvia to yourself why she wooes you by a figure by a letter i should say what need she when she hath made you write to yourself why do you not perceive the jest no believing you indeed sir but did you perceive her earnest why she hath given you a letter and that letter hath she delivered and there an end ill warrant you tis as well for often have you writ to her and she in modesty or else for want of idle time could not again reply or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover all this i speak in print for in print i found it why muse you sir tis dinnertime ay but hearken sir though the chameleon love can feed on the air i am one that am nourished by my victuals and would fain have meat o be not like your mistress be moved be moved master sir thurio frowns on you not of you twere good you knocked him launce by mine honesty welcome to milan come on you madcap ill to the alehouse with you presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes but sirrah how did thy master part with madam julia but shall she marry him how then shall he marry her what are they broken why then how stands the matter with them what an ass art

fear so much master be one of them its an honourable kind of thieverybut say lucetta now we are alone wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love of all the fair resort of gentlemen that every day with parle encounter me in thy opinion which is worthiest love what thinkst thou of the fair sir eglamour what thinkst thou of the rich mercatio what thinkst thou of the gentle proteus how now what means this passion at his name why not on proteus as of all the rest your reason and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him why he of all the rest hath never moved me his little speaking shows his love but small they do not love that do not show their love i would i knew his mind to julia say from whom say say who gave it thee now by my modesty a goodly broker dare you presume to harbour wanton lines to whisper and conspire against my youth now trust me tis an office of great worth and you an officer fit for the place or else return no more into my sight will ye be gone and yet i would i had oerlooked the letter it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her what a fool is she that knows i am a maid and would not force the letter to my view since maids in modesty say no to that which they would have the profferer construe ay fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when willingly i would have had her here how angerly i taught my brow to frown when inward joy enforced my heart to smile my penance is to call lucetta back and ask remission for my folly past what ho lucetta ist near dinnertime what ist that you took up so gingerly why didst thou stoop then and is that paper nothing then let it lie for those that it concerns some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme as little by such toys as may be possible best sing it to the tune of light o love heavy belike it hath some burden then and why not you lets see your song how now minion you do not you minion are too saucy the mean is drownd with your unruly bass this babble shall not henceforth trouble me here is a coil with protestation   go get you gone and let the papers lie you would be fingering them to anger me nay would i were so angerd with the same o hateful hands to tear such loving words injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey and kill the bees that yield it with your stings ill kiss each several paper for amends look here is writ kind julia unkind julia as in revenge of thy ingratitude i throw thy name against the bruising stones trampling contemptuously on thy disdain and here is writ lovewounded proteus poor wounded name my bosom as a bed shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heald and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss but twice or thrice was proteus written down be calm good wind blow not a word away till i have found each letter in the letter except mine own name that some whirlwind bear unto a ragged fearfulhanging rock and throw it thence into the raging sea lo here in one line is his name twice writ poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus to the sweet julia that ill tear away and yet i will not sith so prettily he couples it to his complaining names thus will i fold them one on another now kiss embrace contend do what you will well let us go if you respect them best to take them up i see you have a months mind to them come come willt please you go i must where is no remedy if you turn not you will return the sooner keep this remembrance for thy julias sake and seal the bargain with a holy kiss counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me and even in kind love i do conjure thee who art the table wherein all my thoughts are visibly characterd and engraved to lesson me and tell me some good mean how with my honour i may undertake a journey to my loving proteus a truedevoted pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps much less shall she that hath loves wings to fly and when the flight is made to one so dear of such divine perfection as sir proteus o knowst thou not his looks are my souls food pity the dearth that i have pined in by longing for that food so long a time didst thou but know the inly touch of love thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words the more thou dammst it up the more it burns the current that with gentle murmur glides thou knowst being stoppd impatiently doth rage but when his fair course is not hindered he makes sweet music with the enamelled stones giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wild ocean then let me go and hinder not my course ill be as patient as a gentle stream and make a pastime of each weary step till the last step have brought me to my love and there ill rest as after much turmoil a blessed soul doth in elysium not like a woman for i would prevent the loose encounters of lascivious men gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds as may beseem some wellreputed page no girl ill knit it up in silken strings with twenty oddconceited truelove knots to be fantastic may become a youth of greater time than i shall show to be that fits as well as tell me good my lord what compass will you wear your farthingale why even what fashion thou best likest lucetta out out lucetta that would be illfavourd lucetta as thou lovest me let me have what thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly but tell me wench how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey i fear me it will make me scandalized nay that i will not that is the least lucetta of my fear a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus base men that use them to so base effect but truer stars did govern proteus birth his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from his heart his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth now as thou lovest me do him not that wrong to bear a hard opinion of his truth only deserve my love by loving him and presently go with me to my chamber to take a note of what i stand in need of to furnish me upon my longing journey all that is mine i leave at thy dispose my goods my lands my reputation only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence come answer not but to it presently i am impatient of my tarriance marry mine host because i cannot be merry but shall i hear him speak that will be music is he among these you mistake the musician likes me not he plays false father not so but yet so false that he grieves my very heartstrings ay i would i were deaf it makes me have a slow heart not a whit when it jars so ay that change is the spite i would always have one play but one thing but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on often resort unto this gentlewoman where is launce peace stand aside the company parts aside        twere false if i should speak it for i am sure she is not buried aside  he heard not that aside  if twere a substance you would sure deceive it and make it but a shadow as i am host will you go pray you where lies sir proteus not so but it hath been the longest night that eer i watchd and the most heaviest in what you please ill do what i can it seems you loved not her to leave her token she is dead belike alas i cannot choose but pity her because methinks that she loved you as well as you do love your lady silvia she dreams of him that has forgot her love you dote on her that cares not for your love tis pity love should be so contrary and thinking of it makes me cry alas how many women would do such a message alas poor proteus thou hast entertaind a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs alas poor fool why do i pity him that with his very heart despiseth me because he loves her he despiseth me because i love him i must pity him this ring i gave him when he parted from me to bind him to remember my good will and now am i unhappy messenger to plead for that which i would not obtain to carry that which i would have refused to praise his faith which i would have dispraised i am my masters trueconfirmed love but cannot be true servant to my master unless i prove false traitor to myself yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly as heaven it knows i would not have him speed   gentlewoman good day i pray you be my mean to bring me where to speak with madam silvia if you be she i do entreat your patience to hear me speak the message i am sent on from my master sir proteus madam ay madam madam please you peruse this letter pardon me madam i have unadvised deliverd you a paper that i should not this is the letter to your ladyship it may not be good madam pardon me madam he sends your ladyship this ring she thanks you i thank you madam that you tender her poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much almost as well as i do know myself to think upon her woes i do protest that i have wept a hundred several times i think she doth and thats her cause of sorrow she hath been fairer madam than she is when she did think my master loved her well she in my judgment was as fair as you but since she did neglect her lookingglass and threw her sunexpelling mask away the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks and pinchd the lilytincture of her face that now she is become as black as i about my stature for at pentecost when all our pageants of delight were playd our youth got me to play the womans part and i was trimmd in madam julias gown which served me as fit by all mens judgments as if the garment had been made for me therefore i know she is about my height and at that time i made her weep agood for i did play a lamentable part madam twas ariadne passioning for theseus perjury and unjust flight which i so lively acted with my tears that my poor mistress moved therewithal wept bitterly and would i might be dead if i in thought felt not her very sorrow and she shall thank you fort if eer you know her a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful i hope my masters suit will be but cold since she respects my mistress love so much alas how love can trifle with itself here is her picture let me see i think if i had such a tire this face of mine were full as lovely as is this of hers and yet the painter flatterd her a little unless i flatter with myself too much her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow if that be all the difference in his love ill get me such a colourd periwig her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine ay but her foreheads low and mines as high what should it be that he respects in her but i can make respective in myself if this fond love were not a blinded god come shadow come and take this shadow up for tis thy rival o thou senseless form thou shalt be worshippd kissd loved and adored and were there sense in his idolatry my substance should be statue in thy stead ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake that used me so or else by jove i vow i should have scratchd out your unseeing eyes to make my master out of love with thee aside  but love will not be spurrd to what it loathes aside  tis true such pearls as put out ladies eyes for i had rather wink than look on them aside  but better indeed when you hold your peace aside  she needs not when she knows it cowardice aside  true from a gentleman to a fool aside  that such an ass should owe them here comes the duke and i will follow more to cross that love than hate for silvia that is gone for love aside  and me when he approacheth to your presence o me unhappy o good sir my master charged me to deliver a ring to madam silvia which out of my neglect was never done here tis this is it o cry you mercy sir i have mistook this is the ring you sent to silvia and julia herself did give it me and julia herself hath brought it hither behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths and entertaind em deeply in her heart how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root o proteus let this habit make thee blush be thou ashamed that i have took upon me such an immodest raiment if shame live in a disguise of love it is the lesser blot modesty finds women to change their shapes than men their minds and i mineay madam so you stumble not unheedfully please you repeat their names ill show my mind according to my shallow simple skill as of a knight wellspoken neat and fine but were i you he never should be mine well of his wealth but of himself so so lord lord to see what folly reigns in us pardon dear madam tis a passing shame that i unworthy body as i am should censure thus on lovely gentlemen then thus of many good i think him best i have no other but a womans reason i think him so because i think him so ay if you thought your love not cast away yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye fire thats closest kept burns most of all o they love least that let men know their love peruse this paper madam that the contents will show valentines page and sent i think from proteus he would have given it you but i being in the way did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray to plead for love deserves more fee than hate that you may ruminate what would your ladyship i would it were that you might kill your stomach on your meat and not upon your maid nothing to take a paper up that i let fall nothing concerning me madam it will not lie where it concerns unless it have a false interpeter that i might sing it madam to a tune give me a note your ladyship can set it is too heavy for so light a tune ay and melodious were it would you sing it i cannot reach so high keep tune there still so you will sing it out and yet methinks i do not like this tune no madam it is too sharp nay now you are too flat and mar the concord with too harsh a descant there wanteth but a mean to fill your song indeed i bid the base for proteus she makes it strange but she would be best pleased to be so angerd with another letter madam dinner is ready and your father stays what shall these papers lie like telltales here nay i was taken up for laying them down yet here they shall not lie for catching cold ay madam you may say what sights you see i see things too although you judge i wink alas the way is wearisome and long better forbear till proteus make return i do not seek to quench your loves hot fire but qualify the fires extreme rage lest it should burn above the bounds of reason but in what habit will you go along why then your ladyship must cut your hair what fashion madam shall i make your breeches you must needs have them with a codpiece madam a round hose madam nows not worth a pin unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on if you think so then stay at home and go not then never dream on infamy but go if proteus like your journey when you come no matter whos displeased when you are gone i fear me he will scarce be pleased withal all these are servants to deceitful men pray heaven he prove so when you come to himtell me panthino what sad talk was that wherewith my brother held you in the cloister why what of him nor needst thou much importune me to that whereon this month i have been hammering i have considerd well his loss of time and how he cannot be a perfect man not being tried and tutord in the world experience is by industry achieved and perfected by the swift course of time then tell me whither were i best to send him i know it well i like thy counsel well hast thou advised and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it the execution of it shall make known even with the speediest expedition i will

islands far away some to the studious universities for any or for all these exercises he said that proteus your son was meet and did request me to importune you to let him spend his time no more at home which would be great impeachment to his age in having known no travel in his youth i think your lordship is not ignorant how his companion youthful valentine attends the emperor in his royal court twere good i think your lordship sent him thither there shall he practise tilts and tournaments hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen and be in eye of every exercise worthy his youth and

and thy true love died upon whose grave thou vowdst pure chastity sir eglamour i would to valentine to mantua where i hear he makes abode and for the ways are dangerous to pass i do desire thy worthy company upon whose faith and honour i repose urge not my fathers anger eglamour but think upon my grief a ladys grief and on the justice of my flying hence to keep me from a most unholy match which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues i do desire thee even from a heart as full of sorrows as the sea of sands to bear me company and go with me if not to hide what i have said to thee that i

lifes as tender to me as my soul and full as much for more there cannot be i do detest false perjured proteus therefore be gone solicit me no more when proteus cannot love where hes beloved read over julias heart thy first best love for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith into a thousand oaths and all those oaths descended into perjury to love me thou hast no faith left now unless thoudst two and thats far worse than none better have none than plural faith which is too much by one thou counterfeit to thy true friend all men but proteus o heavennay twill be this hour ere i have done weeping all the kind of the launces have this very fault i have received my proportion like the prodigious son and am going with sir proteus to the imperials court i think crab my dog be the sourestnatured dog that lives my mother weeping my father wailing my sister crying our maid howling our cat wringing her hands and all our house in a great perplexity yet did not this cruelhearted cur shed one tear he is a stone a very pebble stone and has no more pity in him than a dog a jew would have wept to have seen our parting why my grandam having no eyes look you wept herself blind at my parting nay ill show you the manner of it this shoe is my father no this left shoe is my father no no this left shoe is my mother nay that cannot be so neither yes it is so it is so it hath the worser sole this shoe with the hole in it is my mother and this my father a vengeance ont there tis now sit this staff is my sister for look you she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand this hat is

that ever any man tied why he thats tied here crab my dog for fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue in thy tale lose the tide and the voyage and the master and the service and the tied why man if the river were dry i am able to fill it with my tears if the wind were down i could drive the boat with my sighs sir call me what thou darest well i will go forswear not thyself sweet youth for i am not welcome i reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hanged nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say welcome marry after they closed in earnest they parted very fairly in jest no no neither no they are both as whole as a fish marry thus when it stands well with him it stands well with her what a block art thou that thou canst not my staff understands me ay and what i do too look thee ill but lean and my staff understands me why standunder and understand is all one ask my dog if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable i never knew him otherwise a notable lubber as thou reportest him to be why fool i meant not thee i meant thy master why i tell thee i care not though he burn himself in love if thou wilt go with me to the alehouse if not thou art an hebrew a jew and not worth the name of a christian because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a christian wilt thou go soho soho him we go to find theres not a hair ons head but tis a valentine can nothing speak master shall i strike nothing why sir ill strike nothing i pray you sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished i am but a fool look you and yet i have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave but thats all one if he be but one knave he lives not now that knows me to be in love yet i am in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who tis i love and yet tis a woman but what woman i will not tell myself and yet tis a milkmaid yet tis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet tis a maid for she is her masters maid and serves for wages she hath more qualities than a waterspaniel which is much in a bare christian   here is the catelog of her condition imprimis she can fetch and carry why a horse can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a jade item she can milk look you a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands with my masters ship why it is at sea the blackest news that ever thou heardest why as black as ink fie on thee jolthead thou canst not read i will try thee tell me this who begot thee o illiterate loiterer it was the son of thy grandmother this proves that thou canst not read there and st nicholas be thy speed ay that she can and thereof comes the proverb blessing of your heart you brew good ale thats as much as to say can she so what need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can knit him a stock a special virtue for then she need not be washed and scoured then may i set the world on wheels when she can spin for her living thats as much as to say bastard virtues that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names close at the heels of her virtues well that fault may be mended with a breakfast read on that makes amends for her sour breath its no matter for that so she sleep not in her talk o villain that set this down among her vices to be slow in words is a womans only virtue i pray thee out witht and place it for her chief virtue out with that too it was eves legacy and cannot be taen from her i care not for that neither because i love crusts well the best is she hath no teeth to bite if her liquor be good she shall if she will not i will for good things should be praised of her tongue she cannot for thats writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that ill keep shut now of another thing she may and that cannot i help well proceed stop there ill have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article rehearse that once more more hair than wit it may be ill prove it the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the greater hides the less whats next thats monstrous o that that were out why that word makes the faults gracious well ill have her and if it be a match as nothing is impossible why then will i tell theethat thy master stays for thee at the northgate for thee ay who art thou he hath stayed for a better man than thee thou must run to him for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn now will he be swinged for reading my letter an unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets ill after to rejoice in the boys correction when a mans servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard one that i brought up of a puppy one that i saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it i have taught him even as one would say precisely thus i would teach a dog i was sent to deliver him as a present to mistress silvia from my master and i came no sooner into the diningchamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capons leg o tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies i would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things if i had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did i think verily he had been hanged fort sure as i live he had suffered fort you shall judge he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the dukes table he had not been therebless the marka pissing while but all the chamber smelt him out with the dog says one what cur is that says another whip him out says the third hang him up says the duke i having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs friend quoth i you mean to whip the dog ay marry do i quoth he you do him the more wrong quoth i twas i did the thing you wot of he makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber how many masters would do this for his servant nay ill be sworn i have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen otherwise he had been executed i have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed otherwise he had suffered fort thou thinkest not of this now nay i remember the trick you served me when i took my leave of madam silvia did not i bid thee still mark me and do as i do when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewomans farthingale didst thou ever see me do such a trick marry sir i carried mistress silvia the dog you bade me marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present no indeed did she not here have i brought him back again ay sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the marketplace and then i offered her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift the greaterseem you that you are not so do counterfeits what seem i that i am not what instance of the contrary and how quote you my folly my jerkin is a doublet how that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air ay sir and done too for this time sir if you spend word for word with me i shall make your wit bankrupt they say that love hath not an eye at all madam my lord your father would speak with you since his exile she hath despised me most forsworn my company and raild at me that i am desperate of obtaining her therefore as you unwind her love from him lest it should ravel and be good to none you must provide to bottom it on me which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine and thy advice this night ill put in practise therefore sweet proteus my directiongiver let us into the city presently to sort some gentlemen well skilld in music i have a sonnet that will serve the turn to give the onset to thy good advice how now sir proteus are you crept before us ay but i hope sir that you love not here who silvia i thank you for your own now gentlemen lets tune and to it lustily awhile where meet we farewell sir proteus what says silvia to my suit what that my leg is too long ill wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder what says she to my face nay then the wanton lies my face is black how likes she my discourse but well when i discourse of love and peace what says she to my valour what says she to my birth considers she my possessions wherefore not i why this it is to be a peevish girl that flies her fortune when it follows her ill after more to be revenged on eglamour than for the love of reckless silvia yonder is silvia and silvias mine sir valentine i care not for her i i hold him but a fool that will endanger his body for a girl that loves him not i claim her not and therefore she is thinenow daughter silvia you are hard beset sir valentine your fathers in good health what say you to a letter from your friends of much good news know ye don antonio your countryman hath he not a son you know him well beshrew me sir but if he make this good he is as worthy for an empress love as meet to be an emperors counsellor well sir this gentleman is come to me with commendation from great potentates and here he means to spend his time awhile i think tis no unwelcome news to you welcome him then according to his worth silvia i speak to you and you sir thurio for valentine i need not cite him to it i will send him hither to you presently sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile we have some secrets to confer about   now tell me proteus whats your will with me proteus i thank thee for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judged me fast asleep and oftentimes have purposed to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man a rashness that i ever yet have shunnd i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tower the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she cannot be conveyd away upon mine honour he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this sir valentine whither away so fast be they of much import nay then no matter stay with me awhile i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near wherein thou must be secret tis not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherishd by her childlike duty i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her weddingdower for me and my possessions she esteems not there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my aged eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is changed how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sunbright eye but she did scorn a present that i sent her but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from resort of men that no man hath access by day to her ay but the doors be lockd and keys kept safe that no man hath recourse to her by night her chamber is aloft far from the ground and built so shelving that one cannot climb it without apparent hazard of his life now as thou art a gentleman of blood advise me where i may have such a ladder this very night for love is like a child that longs for every thing that he can come by but hark thee i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn then let me see thy cloak ill get me one of such another length how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me what letter is this same whats here to silvia and here an engine fit for my proceeding ill be so bold to break the seal for once   my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly and slaves they are to me that send them flying o could their master come and go as lightly himself would lodge where senseless they are lying my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them while i their king that hither them importune do curse the grace that with such grace hath blessd them because myself do want my servants fortune i curse myself for they are sent by me that they should harbour where their lord would be whats here silvia this night i will enfranchise thee tis so and heres the ladder for the purpose why phaetonfor thou art merops son wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car and with thy daring folly burn the world wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee go base intruder overweening slave bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates and think my patience more than thy desert is privilege for thy departure hence thank me for this more than for all the favours which all too much i have bestowd on thee but if thou linger in my territories longer than swiftest expedition will give thee time to leave our royal court by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love i ever bore my daughter or thyself be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse but as thou lovest thy life make speed from hence sir thurio fear not but that she will love you now valentine is banishd from her sight this weak impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice which with an hours heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot   how now sir proteus is your countryman according to our proclamation gone my daughter takes his going grievously so i believe but thurio thinks not so proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee thou knowst how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio ay but shell think that it is spoke in hate then you must undertake to slander him where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentines report you are already loves firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friends sake will be glad of you where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend ay much is the force of heavenbred poesy this discipline shows thou hast been in love about it gentlemen even now about it i will pardon you how now sir proteus how now thurio which of you saw sir eglamour of late saw you my daughter why then shes fled unto that peasant valentine and eglamour is in her company tis true for friar laurence met them both as he in penance wanderd through the forest him he knew well and guessd that it was she but being maskd he was not sure of it besides she did intend confession at patricks cell this even and there she was not these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence therefore i pray you stand not to discourse but mount you presently and meet with me upon the rising of the mountainfoot that leads towards mantua whither they are fled dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me sir valentine the more degenerate and base art thou to make such means for her as thou hast done and leave her on such slight conditions now by the honour of my ancestry i do applaud thy spirit valentine and think thee worthy of an empress love know then i here forget all former griefs cancel all grudge repeal thee home again plead a new state in thy unrivalld merit to which i thus subscribe sir valentine thou art a gentleman and well derived take thou thy silvia for thou hast deserved her i grant it for thine own whateer it be thou hast prevaild i pardon them and thee dispose of them as thou knowst their deserts come let us go we will include all jars with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes what mean you by that sayingfellows stand fast i see a passenger stand sir and throw us that you have about ye
