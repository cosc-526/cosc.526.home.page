if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as i have said great difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we cannot with such magnificencein so rarei know not what to say we will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot praise us as little accuse us believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note would they else be content to die if the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had onei think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him beseech you you pay a great deal too dear for whats given freely sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds the heavens continue their loves i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live ay my good lord you had much ado to make his anchor hold when you cast

that his negligence his folly fear among the infinite doings of the world sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord if ever i were wilfulnegligent it was my folly if industriously i playd the fool it was my negligence not weighing well the end if ever fearful to do a thing where i the issue doubted where of the execution did cry out against the nonperformance twas a fear which oft infects the wisest these my lord are such allowd infirmities that honesty is never free of but beseech your grace be plainer with me let me know my trespass by its own visage if i then deny it tis none of mine i

they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate thats likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of sicilia my best camillo we must disguise ourselves shepherdess a fair one are youwell you fit our ages with flowers of winter wherefore gentle maiden do you neglect them say there be yet nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean so over that art which you say adds to nature is an art that nature

violent hefts i have drunk and seen the spider camillo was his help in this his pander there is a plot against my life my crown alls true that is mistrusted that false villain whom i employd was preemployd by him he has discoverd my design and i remain a pinchd thing yea a very trick for them to play at will how came the posterns so easily open i knowt too well give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him and let her sport herself with that shes big with for tis polixenes has made thee swell thus you my lords look on her mark her well be but about to say she is a goodly lady and the justice of your bearts will thereto add tis pity shes not honest honourable praise her but for this her withoutdoor form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth useo i am out that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs these hums and has when you have said shes goodly come between ere you can say shes honest but be t known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be shes an adulteress you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which ill not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said shes an adulteress i have said with whom more shes a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that shes a bedswerver even as bad as those that vulgars give boldst titles ay and privy to this their late escape no

whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me have i done well though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to the minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to the truth so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confined lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform come follow us we are to speak in public for this business will raise us all nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness to bear the matter thus mere weakness if the cause were not in beingpart o the cause she

reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing t and being done he most humane and filld with honour to my kingly guest unclaspd my practise quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the hazard of all encertainties himself commended no richer than his honour how he glisters thorough my rust and how his pity does my deeds make the blacker go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual once a day ill visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it come and lead me unto these sorrows whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man bred his hopes out of i think so killd she i killd i did so but thou strikest me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honour o that ever i had squared me to thy counsel then even now i might have lookd upon my queens full eyes have taken treasure from her lips thou speakst truth no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better used would make her sainted spirit again possess her

them to our embracement still tis strange   he thus should steal upon us prithee no more cease thou knowst he dies to me again when talkd of sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason they are come   your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you were i but twentyone your fathers image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us performd before most dearly welcome and your fair princessgoddesso alas i lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do and then i lost all mine own follythe society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him o my brother good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behindhand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to the earth and hath he too exposed this paragon to the fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less the adventure of her person where the warlike smalus that noble honourd lord is feard and loved the blessed gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your fathers blest as he from heaven merits it

of a king that once i see by your good fathers speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her would he do so ild beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle i thought of her even in these looks i made   but your petition is yet unanswerd i will to your father your honour not oerthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee o paulina we honour you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we passd through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother her natural posture chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so aged as this seems as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i wood her i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it o royal piece theres magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee do not draw the curtain let be let be would i were dead but that methinks already what was he that did make it see my lord would you not deem it breathed and that those veins did verily bear blood the fixture of her eye has motion int as we are mockd with art o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness let t alone do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort still methinks there is an air comes from her what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me for i will kiss her no not these twenty years what you can make her do i am content to look on what to speak i am content to hear for tis as easy to make her speak as move proceed no foot shall stir o shes warm if this be magic let it be an art lawful as eating o peace paulina thou shouldst a husband take by my consent as i by thine a wife this is a match and made betweens by vows thou hast found mine but how is to be questiond for i saw her as i thought dead and have in vain said many a prayer upon her grave ill not seek far for him i partly know his mindto find thee an honourable husband come camillo and take her

nayward should a villain say so the most replenishd villain in the world he were as much more villain you my lord do but mistake no by my life privy to none of this how will this grieve you when you shall come to clearer knowledge that you thus have publishd me gentle my lord you scarce can right me throughly then to say you did mistake theres some ill planet reigns i must be patient till the heavens look with an aspect more favourable good my lords i am not prone to weeping as our sex commonly are the want of which vain dew perchance shall dry your pities but i have that honourable grief lodged here which burns worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords with thoughts so qualified as your charities shall best instruct you measure me and so the kings will be performd who ist that goes with me beseech your highness my women may be with me for you see my plight requires it do not weep good fools there is no cause when you shall know your mistress has deserved prison then abound in tears as i come out this action i now go on is for my better grace adieu my lord i never wishd to see you sorry now i trust i shall my women come you have leave since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me to say not guilty mine integrity being counted falsehood shall as i express it be so received but thus if powers divine behold our human actions as they do i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience you my lord best know who least will seem to do so my past life hath been as continent as chaste as true as i am now unhappy which is more than history can pattern though devised and playd to take spectators for behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe a moiety of the throne a great kings daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honour fore who please to come and hear for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour tis a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for i appeal to your own conscience sir before polixenes came to your court how i was in your grace how merited to be so since he came with what encounter so uncurrent i have straind to appear thus if one jot beyond the bound of honour or in act or will that way inclining hardend be the hearts of all that hear me and my nearst of kin cry fie upon my grave thats true enough through tis a saying sir not due to me more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault i must not at all acknowledge for polixenes with whom i am accused i do confess i loved him as in honour he required with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke even since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dishd for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant sir you speak a language that i understand not my life stands in the level of your dreams which ill lay down sir spare your threats the bug which you would fright me with i seek to me can life be no commodity the crown and comfort of my life your favour i do give lost for i do feel it gone but know not how it went my second joy and firstfruits of my body from his presence i am barrd like one infectious my third comfort starrd most unluckily is from my breast the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth haled out to murder myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred the childbed privilege denied which longs to women of all fashion lastly hurried here to this place i the open air before i have got strength of limit now my liege tell me what blessings i have here alive that i should fear to die therefore proceed but yet hear this mistake me not no life i prize it not a straw but for mine honour which i

have him wed again there is none worthy respecting her thats gone besides the gods will have fulfilld their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said ist not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills   care not for issue the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to the worthiest so his successor was like to be the best and left them more rich for what they yielded had she such power she had just cause i should so were i the ghost that walkd ild bid you mark her eye and tell me for what dull part int you chose her then ild shriek that even your ears should rift to hear me and the words that followd should be remember mine will you swear never to marry but by my free leave

our prince jewel of children seen this hour he had paird well with this lord there was not full a month between their births sir my liege your eye hath too much youth int not a month fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now what sovereign sir i did not well i meant well all my services you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed with your crownd brother and these your contracted heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit it is a surplus of your grace which never my life may last to answer as she lived peerless so her dead likeness i do well believe excels whatever yet you lookd upon or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it lonely apart but here it is prepare to see the life as lively mockd as ever still sleep mockd death behold and say tis

and married a tinkers wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue some call him autolycus very true sir he sir he thats the

april forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her the ballad is very pitiful and as true five justices hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold this is a merry ballad but a very pretty one why this is a passing merry one

first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means i saw whose purse was best in picture and what i saw to my good use i remembered my clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse i could have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing no feeling but my sirs song and admiring the nothing of it so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and the kings son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not left a purse alive in the whole army if they have overheard me now why hanging i am a poor fellow sir i am a poor fellow sir   i know ye well enough are you in earnest sir   i smell the trick ont indeed i have had earnest but i cannot with conscience take it adieu sir i understand the business i hear it to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do any thing extempore the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not dot i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession   aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lanes end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work aside  very wisely puppies aside  i know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master aside  though i am not naturally honest i am so sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlars excrement   how now rustics whither are you bound your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and any thing that is fitting to be known discover a lie you are rough and hairy let me have no lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings hath not my gait in it the measure of the court receives not thy nose courtodor from me reflect i not on thy baseness courtcontempt thinkest thou for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy business i am therefore no courtier i am courtier capape and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon i command thee to open thy affair what advocate hast thou to him how blessed are we that are not simple men yet nature might have made me as these are therefore i will not disdain the fardel there whats i the fardel wherefore that box age thou hast lost thy labour the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief if that shepherd be not in handfast let him fly the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary an old sheepwhistling rogue a ramtender to offer to have his daughter come into grace some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say idraw our throne into a sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy he has a son who shall be flayed alive then nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasps nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aquavitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall be be set against a brickwall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death but what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offences being so capital tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king being something gently considered ill bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is man shall do it after i have done what i promised well give me the moiety are you a party in this business o thats the case of the shepherds son hang him hell be made an example i will trust you walk before toward the seaside go on the right hand i will but look upon the hedge and follow you if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth i am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement i will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs tot to him will i present them there may be matter in it beseech you sir were you present at this relation i would most gladly know the issue of it now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits   here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune i know you are now sir a gentleman born i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master ay an it like your good worship i will prove so sir to my powerthese your unusual weeds to each part of you do give a life no shepherdess but flora peering in aprils front this your sheepshearing is as a meeting of the petty gods and you the queen ont i bless the time when my good falcon made her flight across thy fathers ground apprehend nothing but jollity the gods themselves humbling their deities to love have taken the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter became a bull and bellowd the green neptune a ram and bleated and the firerobed god golden apollo a poor humble swain as i seem now their transformations were never for a piece of beauty rarer nor in a way so chaste since my desires run not before mine honour nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith thou dearest perdita with these forced thoughts i prithee darken not the mirth o the feast or ill be thine my fair or not my fathers for i cannot be mine own nor any thing to any if i be not thine to this i am most constant though destiny say no be merry gentle strangle such thoughts as these with any thing that you behold the while your guests are coming lift up your countenance as it were the day of celebration of that nuptial which we two have sworn shall come see your guests approach address yourself to entertain them sprightly and lets be red with mirth what like a corse what you do still betters what is done when you speak sweet ild have you do it ever when you sing ild have you buy and sell so so give alms pray so and for the ordering your affairs to sing them too when you do dance i wish you a wave o the sea that you might ever do nothing but that move still still so and own no other function each your doing so singular in each particular crowns what you are doing in the present deed that all your acts are queens i think you have as little skill to fear as i have purpose to put you tot but come our dance i pray your hand my perdita so turtles pair that never mean to part old sir i know she prizes not such trifles as these are the gifts she looks from me are packd and lockd up in my heart which i have given already but not deliverd o hear me breathe my life before this ancient sir who it should seem hath sometime loved i take thy hand this hand as soft as doves down and as white as it or ethiopians tooth or the fannd snow thats bolted by the northern blasts twice oer do and be witness to t and he and more than he and men the earth the heavens and all that were i crownd the most imperial monarch thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge more than was ever mans i would not prize them without her love for her employ them all commend them and condemn them to her service or to their own perdition o that must be i the virtue of your daughter one being dead i shall have more than you can dream of yet enough then for your wonder but come on contract us fore these witnesses i have but what of him he neither does nor shall no good sir he has his health and ampler strength indeed than most have of his age i yield all this but for some other reasons my grave sir which tis not fit you know i not acquaint my father of this business he shall not no he must not come come he must not mark our contract why look you so upon me i am but sorry not afeard delayd but nothing alterd what i was i am more straining on for plucking back not following my leash unwillingly i not purpose it i think camillo it cannot fail but by the violation of my faith and then let nature crush the sides o the earth together and mar the seeds within lift up thy looks from my succession wipe me father i am heir to my affection i am and by my fancy if my reason will thereto be obedient i have reason if

thou to me thy secrets tell or thou goest to the orange or mill thou hast sworn it more to me then whither goest say whitherso tis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherds daughterone that gives out himself prince florizel son of polixenes with his princess she the fairest i have yet beheld desires access to your high presence but few and those but mean ay the most peerless piece of earth i think that eer the sun shone bright on pardon madam the one i have almost forgotyour pardon the other when she has obtaind your eye will have your tongue too this is a creature would she begin a sect might quench the zeal of all professors else make proselytes of who she but bid follow women will love her that she is a woman more worth than any man men that she is the rarest of all women then have you lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherds son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge lets alongi was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be   here comes a gentleman that haply knows more the news rogero what became of his bark and his followers the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted are they returned to the courtnothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it   here comes the lady paulinas steward he can deliver you more how goes it now sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir no what pray you became of antigonus that carried hence the child i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicingmost true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear youll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle of queen hermiones her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter did you see the meeting of the two kings wrecked the same instant of their masters death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found but o the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the manner how she came tot bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an alas i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world could have seen t the woe had been universal no the princess hearing of her mothers statue which is in the keeping of paulinaa piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master julio romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her
