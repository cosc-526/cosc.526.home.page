because thine eye presumes to reach all thy whole heap must die yon sometimes famous princes like thyself drawn by report adventurous by desire tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale that without covering save yon field of stars here they stand martyrs slain in cupids wars and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist for going on deaths net whom none resist scorning advice read the conclusion then which read and not expounded tis decreed as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed prince pericles touch not upon thy life for thats an article within our law as dangerous as the

pericles be dead my heart can lend no succor to my headi have antiochus and with a soul emboldend with the glory of her praise think death no hazard in this enterprise see where she comes apparelld like the spring graces her subjects and her thoughts the king of every virtue gives renown to men her face the book of praises where is read nothing but curious pleasures as from thence sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath could never be her mild companion you gods that made me man and sway in love that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree or die in the adventure be my helps as i am son and servant to your will to compass such a boundless happiness that would be son to great antiochus antiochus i thank thee who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself and by those fearful objects to prepare this body like to them to what i must for death rememberd should be like a mirror who tells us lifes but breath to trust it error ill make my will then and as sick men do who know the world see heaven but feeling woe gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men as every prince should do my riches to the earth from whence they came but my unspotted fire of love to you   thus ready for the way of life or death i wait the sharpest blow antiochus like a bold champion i assume the lists nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage   i am no viper yet i feed on mothers flesh which did me breed i sought a husband in which labour i found that kindness in a father hes father son and husband mild i mother wife and yet his child how they may be and yet in two as you will live resolve it you sharp physic is the last but o you powers that give heaven countless eyes to view mens acts why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it fair glass of light i loved you and could still   were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for hes no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who fingerd to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being playd upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime good sooth i care not for you great king few love to hear the sins they love to act twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it who has a book of all that monarchs do hes more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wandering wind blows dust in others eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them the blind mole casts coppd hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throngd by mans oppression and the poor worm doth die fort kings are earths gods in vice their laws their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it all love the womb that their first being bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now youre both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasure fits an husband not a father and she an eater of her mothers flesh by the defiling of her parents bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed antioch farewell for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will shun no course to keep them from the light one sin i know another doth provoke murders as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my lie be croppd to keep you clear by flight ill shun the danger which i fear to lords without  let none disturb uswhy should this change of thoughts the sad companion dulleyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the days glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i feard is at antioch whose aim seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasures art can joy my spirits nor yet the others distance comfort me then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have afternourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done and so with me the great antiochus gainst whom i am too little to contend since hes so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honour him if he suspect i may dishonour him and what may make him blush in being known hell stop the course by which it might be known with hostile forces hell oerspread the land and with the ostent of war will look so huge amazement shall drive courage from the state our men be vanquishd ere they do resist and subjects punishd that neer thought offence which care of them not pity of myself who am no more but as the tops of trees which fence the roots they grow by and defend them makes both my body pine and soul to languish and punish that before that he would punish all leave us else but let your cares oerlook what shipping and what ladings in our haven and then return to us   helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks if there be such a dart in princes frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face thou knowst i have power to take thy life from thee rise prithee rise sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for it and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid fit counsellor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do thou speakst like a physician helicanus that ministerst a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself attend me then i went to antioch where as thou knowst against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the resthark in thine earas black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemd not to strike but smooth but thou knowst this tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss such fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seemd my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed i knew him tyrannous and tyrants fears decrease not but grow faster than the years and should he doubt it as no doubt he doth that i should open to the listening air how many worthy princes bloods were shed to keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope to lop that doubt hell fill this land with arms and make pretence of wrong that i have done him when all for mine if i may call offence must feel wars blow who spares not innocence which love to all of which thyself art one who now reprovest me for it drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve them i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where ill hear from thee and by whose letters ill dispose myself the care i had and have of subjects good on thee i lay whose wisdoms strength can bear it ill take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will sure crack both but in our orbs well live so round and safe that time of both this truth shall neer convince thou showdst a subjects shine i a true prince lord governor for so we hear you are let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes we have heard your miseries as far as tyre and seen the desolation of your streets nor come we to add sorrow to your tears but to relieve them of their heavy load and these our ships you happily may think are like the trojan horse was stuffd within with bloody veins expecting overthrow are stored with corn to make your needy bread and give them life whom hunger starved half dead arise i pray you rise we do not look for reverence but to love and harbourage for ourself our ships and men which welcome well accept feast here awhile until our stars that frown lend us a smile yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven wind rain and thunder remember earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you and i as fits my nature do obey you alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks washd me from shore to shore and left me breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes and having thrown him from your watery grave here to have death in peace is all hell crave aside  a pretty moral aside  simonides aside  how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men and from their watery empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect peace be at your labour honest fishermen may see the sea hath cast upon your coast a man whom both the waters and the wind in that vast tenniscourt have made the ball for them to play upon entreats you pity him he asks of you that never used to beg i never practised it what i have been i have forgot to know but what i am want teaches me to think on a man throngd up with cold my veins are chill and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help which if you shall refuse when i am dead for that i am a man pray see me buried i thank you sir i did but crave why are all your beggars whipped then aside  how well this honest mirth becomes their labour not well the good king simonides do you call him he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government how far is his court distant from this shore were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish to make one there an armour friends i pray you let me see it thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses thou givest me somewhat to repair myself and though it was mine own part of my heritage which my dead father did bequeath to me with this strict charge even as he left his life keep it my pericles it hath been a shield twixt me and deathand pointed to this brace for that it saved me keep it in like necessity the which the gods

mount myself upon a courser whose delightful steps shall make the gazer joy to see him tread only my friend i yet am unprovided of a pair of bases then honour be but a goal to my will this day ill rise or else add ill to ill tis more by fortune lady than by merit some other is more fit you are right courteous knights by jove i wonder that is king of thoughts these cates resist me she but thought upon yon kings to me like to my fathers picture which tells me in that glory once he was had princes sit like stars about his throne and he the sun for them to reverence none that beheld him but like lesser lights did vail their crowns to his supremacy where now his sons like a glowworm in the night the which hath fire in darkness none in light whereby i see that times the king of men hes both their parent and he is their grave and gives them what he will not what they crave i thank him i thank both him and you and pledge him freely a gentleman of tyre my name pericles my education

your highness so this is tyre and this the court here must i kill king pericles and if i do it not i am sure to be hanged at home tis dangerous well i perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that being bid to ask what he would of the king desired he might know none of his secrets now do i see he had some reason fort for if a king bid a man be a villain hes bound by the indenture of his oath to be one hush here come the lords of tyre aside  how the king gone aside          what from antioch aside  well i perceive i shall not be hangd now although i would but since hes gone the kings seas must please he scaped the land to perish at the sea ill present myself peace to the lords of tyre from him i come with message unto princely pericles but since my landing i have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels my message must return from whence it camemy lord prince pericles is fledjoy and all comfort in your sacred breast they are my liege and stay your coming to present themselves follow me then lord helicane a word know that our griefs are risen to the top and now at length they overflow their banks wrong not yourself then noble helicane but if the prince do live let us salute him or know what grounds made happy by his breath if in the world he live well seek him out if in his grave he rest well find him there and be resolved he lives to govern us or dead gives cause to mourn his funeral and leave us to our free election to wisdom hes a fool that will not yield and since lord helicane enjoineth us we with our travels will endeavour us sir we have a maid in mytilene i durst wager would win some words of himand keep your mind till you return to us peaceful and comfortable it shall no longer grieve without reproof whose death indeeds the strongest in our censure and knowing this kingdom is without a head like goodly buildings left without a roof soon fall to ruinyour noble self that best know how to rule and how to reign we thus submit untoour sovereignpeace peace and give experience tongue they do abuse the king that flatter him for flattery is the bellows blows up sin the thing which is flatterd but a spark to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing whereas reproof obedient and in order fits kings as they are men for they may err when signior sooth here does proclaim a peace he flatters you makes war upon your life prince pardon me or strike me if you please i cannot be much lower than my knees an angry brow dread lord how dare the plants look up to heaven from whence they have their nourishment kneeling i have ground the axe myself do you but strike the blow to bear with patience such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself alas sir well my lord since you have given me leave to speak freely will i speak antiochus you fear and justly too i think you fear the tyrant who either by public war or private treason will take away your life therefore my lord go travel for a while till that his rage and anger be forgot or till the destinies do cut his thread of life your rule direct to any if to me day serves not light more faithful than ill be well mingle our bloods together in the earth from whence we had our being and our birth you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre further to question me of your kings departure his seald commission left in trust with me doth speak sufficiently hes gone to travel if further yet you will be satisfied why as it were unlicensed of your loves he would depart ill give some light unto you being at antioch royal antiochuson what cause i know not took some displeasure at him at least he judged so and doubting lest that he had errd or sinnd to show his sorrow held correct himself so puts himself unto the shipmans toil with whom each minute threatens life or death lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome we have no reason to desire it commended to our master not to us yet ere you shall depart this we desire as friends to antioch we may feast in tyre no escanes know this of me antiochus from incest lived not free for which the most high gods not minding longer to withhold the vengeance that they had in store due to this heinous capital offence even in the height and pride of all his glory when he was seated in a chariot of an inestimable value and his daughter with him a fire from heaven came and shrivelld up their bodies even to loathing for they so stunk that all those eyes adored them ere their fall scorn now their hand should give them burial and yet but justice for though this king were great his greatness was no guard to bar heavens shaft but sin had his reward with me and welcome happy day my lords your griefs for what wrong not your prince you love for honours cause forbear your suffrages if that you love prince pericles forbear take i your wish i leap into the seas wheres hourly trouble for a minutes ease a twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to forbear the absence of your king if in which time expired he not return i shall with aged patience bear your yoke but if i cannot win you to this love go search like nobles like noble subjects and in your search spend your adventurous worth whom if you find and win unto return you shall like diamonds sit about his crown then you love us we you and well clasp hands when peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands that he have his call up some gentlemen gentlemen theres some of worth would come aboard i pray ye greet them fairly and you sir to outlive the age i am and die as i would do first what is your place sir our vessel is of tyre in it the king a man who for this three months hath not spoken to any one nor taken sustenance but to prorogue his grief twould be too tedious to repeat but the main grief springs from the loss of a beloved daughter and a wife you may but bootless is your sight he will not speak to any behold him   this was a goodly person till the disaster that one mortal night drove him to this it is in vain he will not speak to you sure alls effectless yet nothing well omit that bears recoverys name but since your kindness we have stretchd thus far let us beseech you that for our gold we may provision have wherein we are not destitute for want but weary for the staleness sit sir i will recount it to you but see i am prevented shes a gallant lady calls my lord i know not but here is the regent sir of mytilene speaks nobly of her sir tis the governor of mytilene who hearing of your melancholy state did come to see you my lord i hear none sir hail madam and my queenmy dionyza shall we rest us here and by relating tales of others griefs see if twill teach us to forget our own o dionyza who wanteth food and will not say he wants it or can conceal his hunger till he famish our tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes into the air our eyes do weep till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder that if heaven slumber while their creatures want they may awake their helps to comfort them ill then discourse our woes felt several years and wanting breath to speak help me with tears this tarsus oer which i have the government a city on whom plenty held full hand for riches strewd herself even in the streets whose towers bore heads so high they kissd the clouds and strangers neer beheld but wondered at whose men and dames so jetted and adornd like one anothers glass to trim them by their tables were stored full to glad the sight and not so much to feed on as delight all poverty was scornd and pride so great the name of help grew odious to repeat but see what heaven can do by this our change these mouths who but of late earth sea and air were all too little to content and please although they gave their creatures in abundance as houses are defiled for want of use they are now starved for want of exercise those palates who not yet two summers younger must have inventions to delight the taste would now be glad of bread and beg for it those mothers who to nousle up their babes thought nought too curious are ready now to eat those little darlings whom they loved so sharp are hungers teeth that man and wife draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life here stands a lord and there a lady weeping here many sink yet those which see them fall have scarce strength left to give them burial is not this true o let those cities that of plentys cup and her prosperities so largely taste with their superfluous riots hear these tears the misery of tarsus may be theirs here speak out thy sorrows which thou bringst in haste for comfort is too far for us to expect i thought as much one sorrow never comes but brings an heir that may succeed as his inheritor and so in ours some neighbouring nation taking advantage of our misery hath stuffd these hollow vessels with their power to beat us down the which are down already and make a conquest of unhappy me whereas no glorys got to overcome thou speakst like hims untutord to repeat who makes the fairest show means most deceit but bring they what they will and what they can what need we fear the grounds the lowest and we are half way there go tell their general we attend him here to know for what he comes and whence he comes and what he craves welcome is peace if he on peace consist if wars we are unable to resist the which when any shall not gratify or pay you with unthankfulness in thought be it our wives our children or ourselves the curse of heaven and men succeed their evils till whenthe which i hope shall neer be seen your grace is welcome to our town and us your shafts of fortune though they hurt you mortally yet glance full wanderingly on us fear not my lord but think your grace that fed my country with your corn for which the peoples prayers still fall upon you must in your child be thought on if neglection should therein make me vile the common body by you relieved would force me to my duty but if to that my nature need a spur the gods revenge it upon me and mine to the end of generation well bring your grace een to the edge o the shore then give you up to the maskd neptune and the gentlest winds of heaven o dionyza such a piece of slaughter the sun and moon neer lookd upon were i chief lord of all this spacious world ild give it to undo the deed o lady much less in blood than virtue yet a princess to equal any single crown o the earth i the justice of compare o villain leonine whom thou hast poisond too if thou hadst drunk to him t had been a kindness becoming well thy fact what canst thou say when noble pericles shall demand his child o go to well well of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods do like this worst to such proceeding who ever but his approbation added though not his prime consent he did not flow from honourable sources heavens forgive it thou art like the harpy which to betray dost with thine angels face seize with thine eagles talonsthat were to blow at fire in hope to quench it for who digs hills because they do aspire throws down one mountain to cast up a higher o my distressed lord even such our griefs are here theyre but felt and seen with mischiefs eyes but like to groves being toppd they higher rise ill do my best sir o tis too true our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it o your sweet queen that the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither to have blessd mine eyes with her i have one myself who shall not be more dear to my respect than yours my lord thy oath remember thou hast sworn to dot tis but a blow which never shall be known thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon to yield thee so much profit let not conscience which is but cold inflaming love i thy bosom inflame too nicely nor let pity which even women have cast off melt thee but be a soldier to thy purpose the fitter then the gods should have her here she comes weeping for her only mistress death thou art resolved how now marina why do you keep alone how chance my daughter is not with you do not consume your blood with sorrowing you have a nurse of me lord how your favours changed with this unprofitable woe come give me your flowers ere the sea mar it walk with leonine the air is quick there and it pierces and sharpens the stomach come leonine take her by the arm walk with her come come i love the king your father and yourself with more than foreign heart we every day expect him here when he shall come and find our paragon to all reports thus blasted he will repent the breadth of his great voyage blame both my lord and me that we have taken no care to your best courses go i pray you walk and be cheerful once again reserve that excellent complexion which did steal the eyes of young and old care not for me i can go home alone come come i know tis good for you walk half an hour leonine at the least remember what i have said ill leave you my sweet lady for a while pray walk softly do not heat your blood what i must have a care of you why are you foolish can it be undone i think youll turn a child again that she is dead nurses are not the fates to foster it nor ever to preserve she died at night ill say so who can cross it unless you play the pious innocent and for an honest attribute cry out she died by foul play be one of those that think the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence and open this to pericles i do shame to think of what a noble strain you are and of how coward a spirit be it so then yet none does know but you how she came dead nor none can know leonine being gone she did disdain my child and stood between her and her fortunes none would look on her but cast their gazes on marinas face whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day it pierced me through and though you call my course unnatural you not your child well loving yet i find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness performd to your sole daughter and as for pericles what should he say we wept after her hearse and yet we mourn her monument is almost finishd and her epitaphs in glittering golden characters express a general praise to her and care in us at whose expense tis done you are like one that superstitiously doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies but yet i know youll do as i advise   scene ivwheres the lord governor we have descried upon our neighbouring shore a portly sail of ships make hitherward thats the least fear for by the semblance of their white flags displayd they bring us peace and come to us as favourers not as foes i go my lord he had need mean better than his outward show can any way speak in his just commend for by his rusty outside he appears to have practised more the whipstock than the lance he well may be a stranger for he comes to an honourd triumph strangely furnished see not a man in private conference or council has respect with him but hethe gods of greece protect you and well pray for you live noble helicanehere have you seen a mighty king his child i wis to incest bring a better prince and benign lord that will prove awful both in deed and word be quiet then as men should be till he hath passd necessity ill show you those in troubles reign losing a mite a mountain gain the good in conversation to whom i give my benison is still at tarsus where each man thinks all is writ he speken can and to remember what he does build his statue to make him glorious but tidings to the contrary are brought your eyes what need speak i dumb show   good helicane that stayd at home not to eat honey like a drone from others labours for though he strive to killen bad keep good alive and to fulfil his prince desire sends word of all that haps in tyre how thaliard came full bent with sin and had intent to murder him and that in tarsus was not best longer for him to make his rest he doing so put forth to seas where when men been theres seldom ease for now the wind begins to blow thunder above and deeps below make such unquiet that the ship should house him safe is wreckd and split and he good prince having all lost by waves from coast to coast is tost all perishen of man of pelf ne aught escapen but himself till fortune tired with doing bad threw him ashore to give him glad and here he comes what shall be next pardon old gowerthis longs the text now sleep yslaked hath the rout no din but snores the house about made louder by the oerfed breast of this most pompous marriagefeast the cat with eyne of burning coal now crouches fore the mouses hole and crickets sing at the ovens mouth eer the blither for their drouth hymen hath brought the bride to bed where by the loss of maidenhead a babe is moulded be attent and time that is so briefly spent with your fine fancies quaintly eche whats dumb in show ill plain with speech dumb show   by many a dern and painful perch of pericles the careful search by the four opposing coigns which the world together joins is made with all due diligence that horse and sail and high expense can stead the quest at last from tyre fame answering the most strange inquire to the court of king simonides are letters brought the tenor these antiochus and his daughter dead the men of tyrus on the head of helicanus would set on the crown of tyre but he will none the mutiny he there hastes t oppress says to em if king pericles come not home in twice six moons he obedient to their dooms will take the crown the sum of this brought hither to pentapolis yravished the regions round and every one with claps can sound our heirapparent is a king who dreamd who thought of such a thing brief he must hence depart to tyre his queen with child makes her desire which who shall crossalong to go omit we all their dole and woe lychorida her nurse she takes and so to sea their vessel shakes on neptunes billow half the flood hath their keel cut but fortunes mood varies again the grisly north disgorges such a tempest forth that as a duck for life that dives so up and down the poor ship drives the lady shrieks and wellanear does fall in travail with her fear and what ensues in this fell storm shall for itself itself perform i nill relate action may conveniently the rest convey which might not what by me is told in your imagination hold this stage the ship upon whose deck the seatost pericles appears to speak   scene i imagine pericles arrived at tyre welcomed and settled to his own desire his woeful queen we leave at ephesus unto diana there a votaress now to marina bend your mind whom our fastgrowing scene must find at tarsus and by cleon traind in music letters who hath gaind of education all the grace which makes her both the heart and place of general wonder but alack that monster envy oft the wrack of earned praise marinas life seeks to take off by treasons knife and in this kind hath our cleon one daughter and a wench full grown even ripe for marriagerite this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be bet when she weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to the lute she sung and made the nightbird mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given this so darks in philoten all graceful marks that cleons wife with envy rare a present murderer does prepare for good marina that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter the sooner her vile thoughts to stead lychorida our nurse is dead and cursed dionyza hath the pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow the unborn event i do commend to your content only i carry winged time post on the lame feet of my rhyme which never could i so convey unless your thoughts went on my way dionyza does appear with leonine a murderer thus time we waste and longest leagues make short sail seas in cockles have an wish but fort making to take your imagination from bourn to bourn region to region by you being pardond we commit no crime to use one language in each several clime where our scenes seem to live i do beseech you to learn of me who stand i the gaps to teach you the stages of our story pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas attended on by many a lord and knight to see his daughter all his lifes delight old escanes whom helicanus late advanced in time to great and high estate is left to govern bear you it in mind old helicanus goes along behind wellsailing ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to tarsusthink his pilot thought so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on to fetch his daughter home who first is gone like motes and shadows see them move awhile your ears unto your eyes ill reconcile dumb show   see how belief may suffer by foul show this borrowd passion stands for true old woe and pericles in sorrow all devourd with sighs shot through and biggest tears oershowerd leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears never to wash his face nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears a tempest which his mortal vessel tears and yet he rides it out now please you wit the epitaph is for marina writ by wicked dionyza   the fairest sweetst and best lies here who witherd in her spring of year she was of tyrus the kings daughter on whom foul death hath made this slaughter marina was she calld and at her birth thetis being proud swallowd some part o the earth therefore the earth fearing to be oerflowd hath thetis birthchild on the heavens bestowd wherefore she does and swears shell never stint make raging battery upon shores of flint no visor does become black villany so well as soft and tender flattery let pericles believe his daughters dead and bear his courses to be ordered by lady fortune while our scene must play his daughters woe and heavy welladay in her unholy service patience then and think you now are all in mytilene marina thus the brothel scapes and chances into an honest house our story says she sings like one immortal and she dances as goddesslike to her admired lays deep clerks she dumbs and with her needle composes natures own shape of bud bird branch or berry that even her art sisters the natural roses her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry that pupils lacks she none of noble race who pour their bounty on her and her gain she gives the cursed bawd here we her place and to her father turn our thoughts again where we left him on the sea we there him lost whence driven before the winds he is arrived here where his daughter dwells and on this coast suppose him now at anchor the city strived god neptunes annual feast to keep from whence lysimachus our tyrian ship espies his banners sable trimmd with rich expense and to him in his barge with fervor hies in your supposing once more put your sight of heavy pericles think this his bark where what is done in action more if might shall be discoverd please you sit and hark now our sands are almost run more a little and then dumb this my last boon give me for such kindness must relieve me that you aptly will suppose what pageantry what feats what shows what minstrelsy and pretty din the regent made in mytilene to greet the king so he thrived that he is promised to be wived to fair marina but in no wise till he had done his sacrifice as dian bade whereto being bound the interim pray you all confound in featherd briefness sails are filld and wishes fall out as theyre willd at ephesus the temple see our king and all his company that he can hither come so soon is by your fancys thankful doom in antiochus and his daughter you have heard of monstrous lust the due and just reward in pericles his queen and daughter seen although assaild with fortune fierce and keen virtue preserved from fell destructions blast led on by heaven and crownd with joy at last in helicanus may you well descry a figure of truth of faith of loyalty in reverend cerimon there well appears the worth that learned charity aye wears for wicked cleon and his wife when fame had spread their cursed deed and honourd name of pericles to rage the city turn that him and his they in his palace burn the gods for murder seemed so content to punish them although not done but meant so on your patience evermore attending new joy wait on you here our play has endingwhat ho pilch ha come and bring away the nets look how thou stirrest now come away or ill fetch

what mean you sirwhat patchbreech i say alas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them when welladay we could scarce help ourselves why as men do aland the great ones eat up the little ones i can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale a plays and tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at last devours them all at a mouthful such whales have i heard on o the land who never leave gaping till theyve swallowed the whole parish church steeple bells and all no friend cannot you beg heres them in our country greece gets more with

on them they neer come but i look to be washed master i marvel how the fishes live in the sea but master if i had been the sexton i would have been that day in the belfry because he should have swallowed me too and when i had been in his belly i would have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should never have left till he cast bells steeple church and parish up again but if the good king simonides were of my mindwhy man honest good fellow whats that if it be a day fits you search out of the calendar and nobody look after it what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way

of you   who is the second that presents himself and whats the third what is the fourth which shows that beauty hath his power and will which can as well inflame as it can kill and whats the sixth and

makes us scan the outward habit by the inward man but stay the knights are coming we will withdraw into the gallery knights to say youre welcome were superfluous to place upon the volume of your deeds
