have by common voice in election for the roman empery chosen andronicus surnamed pius for many good and great deserts to rome a nobler man a braver warrior lives not this day within the city walls he by the senate is accitd home from weary wars against the barbarous goths that with his sons a terror to our foes hath yoked a nation strong traind up in arms ten years are spent since first he undertook this cause of rome and chastised with arms our enemies pride five times he hath returnd bleeding to rome bearing his valiant sons in coffins from the field and now at last laden with horrors spoils returns the good andronicus to rome renowned titus flourishing in arms let us entreat by honour of his name whom worthily you would have now succeed and in the capitol and senates right whom you pretend to honour and adore that you withdraw you and abate your strength dismiss your followers and as suitors should plead your deserts in peace and humbleness and welcome nephews from

pleasing eloquence is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage where like a sweet melodious bird it sung sweet varied notes enchanting every ear o thus i found her straying in the park seeking to hide herself as doth the deer that hath received some unrecuring wound perchance she weeps because they killd her husband perchance because she knows them innocent patience dear niece good titus dry thine eyes which of your hands hath not defended rome and reard aloft the bloody battleaxe writing destruction on the enemys castle o none of both but are of high desert my hand hath been but idle let it

him in my despite speak thou no more if all the rest will speed i know not marcus but i know it is whether by device or no the heavens can tell is she not then beholding to the man that brought her

horn and hound well give your grace bonjour high emperor upon my feeble knee i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accursed sons accursed if the fault be proved in them i did my lord yet let me be their bail for by my fathers reverend tomb i vow they shall be ready at your highness will to answer their suspicion with their lives come lucius come stay not to talk with them hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in romes great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watchd and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemned sons whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honours lofty bed   for these these tribunes in the dust i write my hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears let my tears stanch the earths dry appetite my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient urns than youthful april shall with all his showers in summers drought ill drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears ill melt the snow and keep eternal springtime on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood   o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead grave tribunes once more i entreat of you why tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me or if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attired in grave weeds rome could afford no tribune like to these a stone is soft as waxtribunes more hard than stones a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death   but wherefore standst thou with thy weapon drawn o happy man they have befriended thee why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banished but who comes with our brother marcus here will it consume me let me see it then fainthearted boy arise and look upon her speak lavinia what accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy fathers sight what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a faggot to brightburning troy my grief was at the height before thou camest and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds give me a sword ill chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nursed this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service are but vain it was my deer and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banished man and here my brother weeping at my woes but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyrd thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemnd and dead by this look marcus ah son lucius look on her when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honeydew upon a gatherd lily almost witherd if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath taen revenge on them no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are staind as meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brinepit with our bitter tears or shall we cut away our hands like thine or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days what shall we do let us that have our tongues plot some deuce of further misery to make us wonderd at in time to come ah marcus marcus brother well i wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine for thou poor man hast drownd it with thine own mark marcus mark i understand her signs had she a tongue to speak now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin with his true tears all bewet can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks o what a sympathy of woe is this as far from help as limbo is from bliss o gracious emperor o gentle aaron did ever raven sing so like a lark that gives sweet tidings of the suns uprise with all my heart ill send the emperor my hand good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off sirs strive no more such witherd herbs as these are meet for plucking up and therefore mine agree between you i will spare my hand o here i lift this one hand up to heaven and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears to that i call   what wilt thou kneel with me do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers or with our sighs well breathe the welkin dim and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms is not my sorrow deep having no bottom then be my passions bottomless with them if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven doth weep doth not the earth oerflow if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face and wilt thou have a reason for this coil i am the sea hark how her sighs do blow she is the weeping welkin i the earth then must my sea be moved with her sighs then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge overflowd and drownd for why my bowels cannot hide her woes but like a drunkard must i vomit them then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues when will this fearful slumber have an end ha ha ha why i have not another tear to shed besides this sorrow is an enemy and would usurp upon my watery eyes and make them blind with tributary tears then which way shall i find revenges cave for these two heads do seem to speak to me and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be returnd again even in their throats that have committed them come let me see what task i have to do you heavy people circle me about that i may turn me to each one of you and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs the vow is made come brother take a head and in this hand the other i will bear lavinia thou shalt be employd these arms bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth as for thee boy go get thee from my sight thou art an exile and thou must not stay hie to the goths and raise an army there and if you love me as i think you do lets kiss and part for we have much to do so so now sit and look

passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast who when my heart all mad with misery beats in this hollow prison of my flesh then thus i thump it down   thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating thou canst not strike it thus to make it still wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans or get some little knife between thy teeth and just against thy heart make thou a hole that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in seasalt tears how now has sorrow made thee dote already why marcus no man should be mad but i what violent hands can she lay on her life ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands to bid aeneas tell the tale twice oer how troy was burnt and he made miserable o handle not the theme to talk of hands lest we remember still that we have none fie fie how franticly i square my talk as if we should forget we had no hands if marcus did not name the word of hands come lets fall to and gentle girl eat this here is no drink hark marcus what she says i can interpret all her martyrd signs she says she drinks no other drink but tears brewd with her sorrow meshd upon her cheeks speechless complainer i will learn thy thought in thy dumb action will i be as perfect as begging hermits in their holy prayers thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign but i of these will wrest an alphabet and by still practise learn to know thy meaning peace

ungrateful rome ah rome well well i made thee miserable what time i threw the peoples suffrages on him that thus doth tyrannize oer me go get you gone and pray be careful all and leave you not a

hast thou done see see thou hast shot off one of taurus horns this was the sport my lord when publius shot the bull being galld gave aries such a knock that down fell both the rams horns in the court and who should find them but the empress villain she laughd and told the moor he should not choose but give them to his master for a present but what says jupiter i ask thee why villain art not thou the carrier tell me can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace who doth molest my contemplation is it your trick to make me ope the door that so my sad decrees may fly away and all my

titus calls   go gentle marcus to thy nephew lucius thou shalt inquire him out among the goths bid him repair to me and bring with him some of the chiefest princes of the goths bid him encamp his

dread queen welcome ye warlike goths welcome lucius and welcome all although the cheer be poor twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it your reason mighty lord now is my turn to speak behold this child   of this was tamora delivered the issue of an irreligious moor chief architect and plotter of these woes the villain is alive in titus house and as he is to witness this is true now judge what cause had titus to revenge these wrongs unspeakable past patience or more than any living man could bear now you have heard the truth what say you romans have we done aught amissshow us wherein and from the place where you behold us now the poor remainder of andronici will hand in hand all headlong cast us down and on the ragged stones beat forth our brains and make a mutual closure of our house speak romans speak and if you say we shall lo hand in hand lucius and i will fallstay roman brethren gracious conqueror victorious titus rue the tears i shed a mothers tears in passion for her son and if thy sons were ever dear to thee o think my son to be as dear to me sufficeth not that we are brought to rome to beautify thy triumphs and return captive to thee and to thy roman yoke but must my sons be slaughterd in the streets for valiant doings in their countrys cause o if to fight for king and commonweal were piety in thine it is in these andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods draw near them then in being merciful sweet mercy is nobilitys true badge thrice noble titus spare my firstborn son o cruel irreligious piety and here in sight of heaven to rome i swear if saturnine advance the queen of goths she will a handmaid be to his desires a loving nurse a mother to his youth my worthy lord if ever tamora were gracious in those princely eyes of thine then hear me speak in indifferently for all and at my suit sweet pardon what is past not so my lord the gods of rome forfend i should be author to dishonour you but on mine honour dare i undertake for good lord titus innocence in all whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs then at my suit look graciously on him lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart   be won at last dissemble all your griefs and discontents you are but newly planted in your throne lest then the people and patricians too upon a just survey take titus part and so supplant you for ingratitude which rome reputes to be a heinous sin yield at entreats and then let me alone ill find a day to massacre them all and raze their faction and their family the cruel father and his traitorous sons to whom i sued for my dear sons life and make them know what tis to let a queen kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain   come come sweet emperor come andronicus take up this good old man and cheer the heart that dies in tempest of thy angry frown titus i am incorporate in rome a roman now adopted happily and must advise the emperor for his good this day all quarrels die andronicus and let it be mine honour good my lord that i have reconciled your friends and you for you prince bassianus i have passd my word and promise to the emperor that you will be more mild and tractable and fear not lords and you lavinia by my advice all humbled on your knees you shall ask pardon of his majesty nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends the tribune and his nephews kneel for grace i will not be denied sweet heart look back my lovely aaron wherefore lookst thou sad when every thing doth make a gleeful boast the birds chant melody on every bush the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind and make a chequerd shadow on the ground under their sweet shade aaron let us sit and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds replying shrilly to the welltuned horns as if a double hunt were heard at once let us sit down and mark their yelping noise and after conflict such as was supposed the wandering prince and dido once enjoyd when with a happy storm they were surprised and curtaind with a counselkeeping cave we may each wreathed in the others arms our pastimes done possess a golden slumber whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds be unto us as is a nurses song of lullaby to bring her babe asleep ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life saucy controller of our private steps had i the power that some say dian had thy temples should be planted presently with horns as was actaeons and the hounds should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs unmannerly intruder as thou art why have i patience to endure all this have i not reason think you to look pale these two have ticed me hither to this place a barren detested vale you see it is the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean oercome with moss and baleful mistletoe here never shines the sun here nothing breeds unless the nightly owl or fatal raven and when they showd me this abhorred pit they told me here at dead time of the night a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins would make such fearful and confused cries as any mortal body hearing it should straight fall mad or else die suddenly no sooner had they told this hellish tale but straight they told me they would bind me here unto the body of a dismal yew and leave me to this miserable death and then they calld me foul adulteress lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms that ever ear did hear to such effect and had you not by wondrous fortune come this vengeance on me had they executed revenge it as you love your mothers life or be ye not henceforth calld my children give me thy poniard you shall know my boys your mothers hand shall right your mothers wrong but when ye have the honey ye desire let not this wasp outlive us both to sting i will not hear her speak away with her i know not what it means away with her hadst thou in person neer offended me even for his sake am i pitiless remember boys i pourd forth tears in vain to save your brother from the sacrifice but fierce andronicus would not relent therefore away with her and use her as you will the worse to her the better loved of me what beggst thou then fond woman let me go so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee no let them satisfy their lust on thee farewell my sons see that you make her sure neer let my heart know merry cheer indeed till all the andronici be made away now will i hence to seek my lovely moor and let my spleenful sons this trull deflowr where is my lord the king where is thy brother bassianus then all too late i bring this fatal writ the complot of this timeless tragedy and wonder greatly that mans face can fold in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny what are they in this pit o wondrous thing how easily murder is discovered andronicus himself did take it up andronicus i will entreat the king fear not thy sons they shall do well enough my gracious lord my lovely saturnine lord of my life commander of my thoughts calm thee and bear the faults of titus age the effects of sorrow for his valiant sons whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarrd his heart and rather comfort his distressed plight than prosecute the meanest or the best for these contempts   why thus it shall become highwitted tamora to gloze with all but titus i have touched thee to the quick thy lifeblood out if aaron now be wise then is all safe the anchors in the port   how now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us empress i am but yonder sits the emperor come sirrah you must be hanged why should you fear is not your city strong king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name is the sun dimmd that gnats do fly in it the eagle suffers little birds to sing and is not careful what they mean thereby knowing that with the shadow of his wings he can at pleasure stint their melody even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome then cheer thy spirit  for know thou emperor i will enchant the old andronicus with words more sweet and yet more dangerous than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep when as the one is wounded with the bait the other rotted with delicious feed if tamora entreat him then he will for i can smooth and fill his aged ear with golden promises that were his heart almost impregnable his old ears deaf yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue   go thou before be our ambassador say that the emperor requests a parley of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting even at his fathers house the old andronicus now will i to that old andronicus and temper him with all the art i have to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths and now sweet emperor be blithe again and bury all thy fear in my devices thus in this strange and sad habiliment i will encounter with andronicus and say i am revenge sent from below to join with him and right his heinous wrongs knock at his study where they say he keeps to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge tell him revenge is come to join with him and work confusion on his enemies titus i am come to talk with thee if thou didst know me thou wouldest talk with me know thou sad man i am not tamora she is thy enemy and i thy friend i am revenge sent from the infernal kingdom to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes come down and welcome me to this worlds light confer with me of murder and of death theres not a hollow cave or lurkingplace no vast obscurity or misty vale where bloody murder or detested rape can couch for fear but i will find them out and in their ears tell them my dreadful name revenge which makes the foul offender quake i am therefore come down and welcome me these are my ministers and come with me rapine and murder therefore called so cause they take vengeance of such kind of men this closing with him fits his lunacy whateer i forge to feed his brainsick fits do you uphold and maintain in your speeches for now he firmly takes me for revenge and being credulous in this mad thought ill make him send for lucius his son and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure ill find some cunning practise out of hand to scatter and disperse the giddy goths or at the least make them his enemies see here he comes and i must ply my theme what wouldst thou have us do andronicus show me a thousand that have done thee wrong and i will be revenged on them all well hast thou lessond us this shall we do but would it please thee good andronicus to send for lucius thy thricevaliant son who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths and bid him come and banquet at thy house when he is here even at thy solemn feast i will bring in the empress and her sons the emperor himself and all thy foes and at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart what says andronicus to this device now will i hence about thy business and take my ministers along with me aside to her sons  what say you boys will you bide with him whiles i go tell my lord the emperor how i have governd our determined jest yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair and tarry with him till i turn again farewell andronicus revenge now goes to lay a complot to betray thy foes we are beholding

nor i no strength to climb without thy help the unhappy son of old andronicus brought hither in a most unlucky hour to find thy brother bassianus dead we know not where you left him all alive but out alas here have we found him deadhe that would vouch it in any place but here not i till mutius bones be buried father and in that name doth nature speak my sight is very dull whateer it bodes what art thou falln what subtle hole is this whose mouth is coverd with rudegrowing briers upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood as fresh as morning dew distilld on flowers a very fatal place it seems to me speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall i am surprised with an uncouth fear a chilling sweat oerruns my trembling joints my heart suspects more than mine eye can see aaron is gone and my

he lives in fame that died in virtues cause lucius all hail romes royal emperor lucius all hail romes gracious governornow climbeth tamora olympus top safe out of fortunes shot and sits aloft secure of thunders crack or lightning flash advanced above pale envys threatening reach as when the golden sun salutes the morn and having gilt the ocean with his beams gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach and overlooks the highestpeering hills so tamora upon her wit doth earthly honour wait and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long hast prisoner held fetterd in amorous chains and faster bound to aarons charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold to wait upon this newmade empress to wait said i to wanton with this queen this goddess this semiramis this nymph this siren that will charm romes saturnine and see his shipwreck and his commonweals holloa what storm is this aside  clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the peace coming forward  why how now lords so near the emperors palace dare you draw and maintain such a quarrel openly full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonourd in the court of rome for shame put up away i say now by the gods that warlike goths adore this petty brabble will undo us all why lords and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a princes right what is lavinia then become so loose or bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels may be broachd without controlment justice or revenge young lords beware and should the empress know this discords ground the music would not please why are ye mad or know ye not in rome how furious and impatient they be and cannot brook competitors in love i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths by this device to achieve her how aside  ay and as good as saturninus may why then it seems some certain snatch or so would serve your turns would you had hit it too then should not we be tired with this ado why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools to square for this would it offend you then that both should speed for shame be friends and join for that you jar tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect and so must you resolve that what you cannot as you would achieve you must perforce accomplish as you may take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia bassianus love a speedier course than lingering languishment must we pursue and i have found the path my lords a solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villany single you thither then this dainty doe and strike her home by force if not by words this way or not at all stand you in hope come come our empress with her sacred wit to villany and vengeance consecrate will we acquaint with all that we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes height advance you both the emperors court is like the house of fame the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns there serve your lusts shadowd from heavens eye and revel in lavinias treasury he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villany and so repose sweet gold for their unrest   that have their alms out of the empress chest madam though venus govern your desires saturn is dominator over mine what signifies my deadlystanding eye my silence and my cloudy melancholy my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls even as an adder when she doth unroll to do some fatal execution no madam these are no venereal signs vengeance is in my heart death in my hand blood and revenge are hammering in my head hark tamora the empress of my soul which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee this is the day of doom for bassianus his philomel must lose her tongue today thy sons make pillage of her chastity and wash their hands in bassianus blood seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee and give the king this fatal plotted scroll now question me no more we are espied here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty which dreads not yet their lives destruction no more great empress bassianus comes be cross with him and ill go fetch thy sons to back thy quarrels whatsoeer they be come on my lords the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep aside  now will i fetch the king to find them here that he thereby may give a likely guess how these were they that made away his brother my gracious lord here is the bag of gold titus andronicus my lord the emperor sends thee this wordthat if thou love thy sons let marcus lucius or thyself old titus or any one of you chop off your hand and send it to the king he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive and that shall be the ransom for their fault nay come agree whose hand shall go along for fear they die before their pardon come aside  if that be calld deceit i will be honest and never whilst i live deceive men so but ill deceive you in another sort and that youll say ere half an hour pass i go andronicus and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee   their heads i mean o how this villany doth fat me with the very thoughts of it let fools do good and fair men call for grace aaron will have his soul black like his face ay some mad message from his mad grandfather ay just a verse in horace right you have it   now what a thing it is to be an ass heres no sound jest the old man hath found their guilt and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines that wound beyond their feeling to the quick but were our witty empress well afoot she would applaud andronicus conceit but let her rest in her unrest awhile and now young lords wast not a happy star led us to rome strangers and more than so captives to be advanced to this height it did me good before the palace gate to brave the tribune in his brothers hearing had he not reason lord demetrius did you not use his daughter very friendly here lacks but your mother for to say amen aside  pray to the devils the gods have given us over well more or less or neer a whit at all here aaron is and what with aaron now why what a caterwauling dost thou keep what dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms to whom well god give her good rest what hath he sent her why then she is the devils dam a joyful issue zounds ye whore is black so base a hue sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure that which thou canst not undo villain i have done thy mother it shall not die what must it nurse then let no man but i do execution on my flesh and blood sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up   stay murderous villains will you kill your brother now by the burning tapers of the sky that shone so brightly when this boy was got he dies upon my scimitars sharp point that touches this my firstborn son and heir i tell you younglings not enceladus with all his threatening band of typhons brood nor great alcides nor the god of war shall seize this prey out of his fathers hands what what ye sanguine shallowhearted boys ye whitelimed walls ye alehouse painted signs coalblack is better than another hue in that it scorns to bear another hue for all the water in the ocean can never turn the swans black legs to white although she lave them hourly in the flood tell the empress from me i am of age to keep mine own excuse it how she can my mistress is my mistress this myself the vigour and the picture of my youth this before all the world do i prefer this maugre all the world will i keep safe or some of you shall smoke for it in rome why theres the privilege your beauty bears fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing the close enacts and counsels of the heart heres a young lad framed of another leer look how the black slave smiles upon the father as who should say old lad i am thine own he is your brother lords sensibly fed of that selfblood that first gave life to you and from that womb where you imprisond were he is enfranchised and come to light nay he is your brother by the surer side although my seal be stamped in his face then sit we down and let us all consult my son and i will have the wind of you keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety why so brave lords when we join in league i am a lamb but if you brave the moor the chafed boar the mountain lioness the ocean swells not so as aaron storms but say again how many saw the child the empress the midwife and yourself two may keep counsel when the thirds away go to the empress tell her this i said   weke weke so cries a pig prepared to the spit o lord sir tis a deed of policy shall she live to betray this guilt of ours a longtongued babbling gossip no lords no and now be it known to you my full intent not far one muli lives my countryman his wife but yesternight was brought to bed his child is like to her fair as you are go pack with him and give the mother gold and tell them both the circumstance of all and how by this their child shall be advanced and be received for the emperors heir and substituted in the place of mine to calm this tempest whirling in the court and let the emperor dandle him for his own hark ye lords ye see i have given her physic   and you must needs bestow her funeral the fields are near and you are gallant grooms this done see that you take no longer days but send the midwife presently to me the midwife and the nurse well made away then let the ladies tattle what they please now to the goths as swift as swallow flies there to dispose this treasure in mine arms and secretly to greet the empress friends come on you thick lippd slave ill bear you hence for it is you that puts us to our shifts ill make you feed on berries and on roots and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat and cabin in a cave and bring you up to be a warrior and command a camp touch not the boy he is of royal blood lucius save the child and bear it from me to the empress if thou do this ill show thee wondrous things that highly may advantage thee to hear if thou wilt not befall what may befall ill speak no more but vengeance rot you all an if it please thee why assure thee lucius twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres acts of black night abominable deeds complots of mischief treason villanies ruthful to hear yet piteously performd and this shall all be buried by my death unless thou swear to me my child shall live swear that he shall and then i will begin what if i do not as indeed i do not yet for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee called conscience with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies which i have seen thee careful to observe therefore i urge thy oath for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears to that ill urge him therefore thou shalt vow by that same god what god soeer it be that thou adorest and hast in reverence to save my boy to nourish and bring him up or else i will discover nought to thee first know thou i begot him on the empress tut lucius this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon twas her two sons that murderd bassianus they cut thy sisters tongue and ravishd her and cut her hands and trimmd her as thou sawst why she was washd and cut and trimmd and twas trim sport for them that had the doing of it indeed i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learnd of me as true a dog as ever fought at head well let my deeds be witness of my worth i traind thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within the letter mentiond confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it i playd the cheater for thy fathers hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pryd me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons heads beheld his tears and laughd so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his  and when i told the empress of this sport she swooned almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses ay like a black dog as the saying is ay that i had not done a thousand more even now i curse the dayand yet i think few come within the compass of my curse wherein i did not some notorious ill as kill a man or else devise his death ravish a maid or plot the way to do it accuse some innocent and forswear myself set deadly enmity between two friends make poor mens cattle break their necks set fire on barns and haystacks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears oft have i diggd up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends doors even when their sorrows almost were forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carved in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead tut i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i cannot do ten thousand more if there be devils would i were a devil to live and burn in everlasting fire so i might have your company in hell but to torment you with my bitter tongue some devil whisper curses in mine ear and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth the venomous malice of my swelling heart o why should wrath be mute and fury dumb i am no baby i that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done ten thousand worse than ever yet i did would i perform if i might have my will if one good deed in all my life i did i do repent it from my very soulwho is this my niece that flies away so fast cousin a word where is your husband if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me if i do wake some planet strike me down that i may slumber in eternal sleep speak gentle niece what stern ungentle hands have loppd and hewd and made thy body bare of her two branches those sweet ornaments whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in and might not gain so great a happiness as have thy love why dost not speak to me alas a crimson river of warm blood like to a bubbling fountain stirrd with wind doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips coming and going with thy honey breath but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue ah now thou turnst away thy face for shame and notwithstanding all this loss of blood as from a conduit with three issuing spouts yet do thy cheeks look red as titans face blushing to be encountered with a cloud shall i speak for thee shall i say tis so o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast that i might rail at him to ease my mind sorrow concealed like an oven stoppd doth burn the heart to cinders where it is fair philomela she but lost her tongue and in a tedious sampler sewd her mind but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met and he hath cut those pretty fingers off that could have better sewd than philomel o had the monster seen those lily hands tremble like aspenleaves upon a lute and make the silken strings delight to kiss them he would not then have touchd them for his life or had he heard the heavenly harmony which that sweet tongue hath made he would have droppd his knife and fell asleep as cerberus at the thracian poets feet come let us go and make thy father blind for such a sight will blind a fathers eye one hours storm will drown the fragrant meads what will whole months of tears thy fathers eyes do not draw back for we will mourn with thee o could our mourning ease thy miseryworthy andronicus ill art thou repaid for that good hand thou sentst the emperor here

did and would not but in fury fright my youth which made me down to throw my books and fly causeless perhaps but pardon me sweet aunt and madam if my uncle marcus go i will most willingly attend your
