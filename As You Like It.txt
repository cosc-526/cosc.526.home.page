so long this wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither which now ill go about o that your highness knew my heart in this i never loved my brother in my life good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description such garments and such years the boy is fair of female favour and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin are you he some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was staind when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinkd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bushs shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural twice did he turn his back and purposed so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked twas i but tis not ii do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed as how i came into that desert place in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brothers love who led me instantly unto his cave there strippd himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recoverd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind many will swoon when they do look on blood look he recovers be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a mans heart this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man that will i for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother rosalind neither call the giddiness of it in question the poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me i love aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other it shall be to your good for my fathers house and all the revenue that was old sir rowlands will i estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd and you fair sister now sir what make you here what mar you then sir marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile know you

but that i kindle the boy thither which now ill go about o that your highness knew my heart in this i never loved my brother in my life good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fenced about with olive trees if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description such garments and such years the boy is fair of female favour and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin are you he some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was staind when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinkd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bushs shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural twice did he turn his back and purposed so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked twas i but tis not ii do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am by and by when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed as how i came into that desert place in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brothers love who led me instantly unto his cave there strippd himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind brief i recoverd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind many will swoon when they do look on blood look he recovers be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a mans heart

did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died

disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou art inclined to sleep by my life she will do as i do or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove

all such offenders and let time try adieu o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love ill tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando ill go find a shadow and sigh till he come how say you now is it not past two oclock and here much orlando patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix ods my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device come come you are a fool and turnd into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestonecolourd hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but twas her hands she has a huswifes hand but thats no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a mans invention and his hand why tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style forchallengers why she defies me like turk to christian womens gentle brain could not drop forth such giantrude invention such ethiope words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes   art thou god to shepherd turnd that a maidens heart hath burnd can a woman rail thus reads why thy godhead laid apart warrst thou with a womans heart did you ever hear such railing whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then ill study how to die do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company i am what must we understand by this but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suckd and hungry lioness wast you he rescued but for the bloody napkin i would i were at home i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how well i

when he showed me your handkerchief o i know where you are nay tis true there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesars thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part them why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger by my life i do which i tender dearly

you be not he ill have no husband if you be not he nor neer wed woman if you be not she it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue if it be true that good wine needs no bush tis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues

could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love leander he would have lived many a fair year though hero had turned nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos but these are all lies men have died from time to

disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou art inclined to sleep by my life she will do as i do or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed marry to say she came to seek you there you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue o that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours ay go your ways go your ways i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me tis but one cast away and so come death two oclock is your hour by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover

all such offenders and let time try adieu o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love ill tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando ill go find a shadow and sigh till he come how say you now is it not past two oclock and here much orlando patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer bear this bear all she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix ods my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device come come you are a fool and turnd into the extremity of love i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestonecolourd hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but twas her hands she has a huswifes hand but thats no matter i say she never did invent this letter this is a mans invention and his hand why tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style forchallengers why she defies me like turk to christian womens gentle brain could not drop forth such giantrude invention such ethiope words blacker in their effect than in their countenance will you hear the letter she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes   art thou god to shepherd turnd that a maidens heart hath burnd can a woman rail thus reads why thy godhead laid apart warrst thou with a womans heart did you ever hear such railing whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me meaning me a beast if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then ill study how to die do you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt thou love such a woman what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endured well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company i am what must we understand by this but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suckd and hungry lioness wast you he rescued but for the bloody napkin i would i were at home i do so i confess it ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited heighho counterfeit i assure you so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him will you go god save you brother o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkerchief o i know where you are nay tis true there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesars thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked no sooner looked but they loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together clubs cannot part them why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind i will weary you then no longer with idle talking know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me believe then if you please that i can do strange things i have since i was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to rosalind if you will   look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers i care not if i have it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you you are there followed by a faithful shepherd look upon him love him he worships you and i for no woman and i for no woman and so am i for no woman who do you speak to why blame you me to love you pray you no more of this tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon   i will help you if i can   i would love you if i could tomorrow meet me all together   i will marry you if ever i marry woman and ill be married tomorrow   i will satisfy you if ever i satisfied man and you shall be married tomorrow   i will content you if what pleases you contents you and you shall be married tomorrow   as you love rosalind meet   as you love phebe meet and as i love no woman ill meet so fare you well i have left you commands patience once more whiles our compact is urged you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here and you say you will have her when i bring her you say youll marry me if i be willing but if you do refuse to marry me youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd you say that youll have phebe if she will i have promised to make all this matter even keep you your word o duke to give your daughter you yours orlando to receive his daughter keep your word phebe that youll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd keep your word silvius that youll marry her if she refuse me and from hence i go to make these doubts all even to duke senior  to you i give myself for i am yours   to you i give myself for i am yours ill have no father if you be not he ill have no husband if you be not he nor neer wed woman if you be not she it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue if it be true that good wine needs no bush tis true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play i am not furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you and ill begin with the women i charge you o women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you o men for the love you bear to womenas i perceive by your simpering none of you hates themthat between you and the women the play may please if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me complexions that liked me and breaths that i defied not and i am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewellmistress you must come away to your father
