intelligence of fords approach and in her invention and fords wifes distraction they conveyed me into a buckbasket by the lord a buckbasket rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril nay you shall hear master brook what i have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good being thus crammed in the basket a couple of fords knaves his hinds were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to datchetlane they took me on their

he should be a cuckold held his hand well on went he for a search and away went i for foul clothes but mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bellwether next to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopped in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease think of thata man of my kidneythink of thatthat am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw it was a

will wonder at the mirth whereof so larded with my matter that neither singly can be manifested without the show of both fat falstaff hath a great scene the image of the jest ill show you here at large hark good mine host tonight at hernes oak just twixt twelve and one must my sweet nan present the fairy queen the purpose why is here in which disguise while other jests are something rank on foot her father hath commanded her to slip away with slender and with him at eton immediately to marry she hath consented now sir her mother ever strong against that match and firm for doctor caius hath appointed that he shall likewise shuffle her away while other sports are tasking of their minds and at the deanery where a priest attends straight marry her to this her mothers plot she seemingly obedient likewise hath made promise to the doctor now thus it rests her father means she shall be all in white and in that habit when slender sees his time to take her by the hand and bid her go she shall go with him her mother hath intended the better to denote her to the doctor for they must all be maskd and vizarded that quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed with ribands pendent flaring bout her head and when the doctor spies his vantage ripe to pinch her by the hand and on that token the maid hath given consent to go with him both my good host to go along with me and here it rests that youll procure the vicar to stay for me at church twixt twelve and one and in the lawful name of marrying to give our hearts united ceremony so shall i evermore be bound to thee besides ill make a present recompense you do amaze her hear the truth of it you would have married her most shamefully where there was no proportion held in love the truth is she and i long since contracted are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us the offence is holy that she hath committed and this deceit loses the name of craft of disobedience or unduteous title since therein she doth evitate and shun a thousand irreligious cursed hours which forced marriage would have brought upon hermistress page trust me i was going to your house we burn daylight here read read perceive how i might be knighted i shall think the worse of fat men as long as i have an eye to make difference of mens liking and yet he would not swear praised womens modesty and gave such orderly and wellbehaved reproof to all uncomeliness that i would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the hundredth psalm to the tune of green sleeves what tempest i trow threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his belly ashore at windsor how shall i be revenged on him i think the best way were to entertain him with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease did you ever hear the like well i hope it be not so why sir my wife is not young love my wife what name sir aside  i will be patient i will find out this i will seek out falstaff if i do find it well twas a good sensible fellow well i melancholy i am not melancholy get you home go you heard what this knave told me did you not do you think there is truth in them were they his men i like it never the better for that does he lie at the garter i do not misdoubt my wife but i would be loath to turn them together a man may be too confident i would have nothing lie on my head i cannot be thus satisfied good mine host o the garter a word with you none i protest but ill give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him my name is brook only for a jest though page be a secure fool an stands so firmly on his wifes frailty yet i cannot put off my opinion so easily she was in his company at pages house and what they made there i know not well i will look further intot and i have a disguise to sound falstaff if i find her honest i lose not my labour if she be otherwise tis labour well bestowed bless you sir i make bold to press with so little preparation upon you sir i am a gentleman that have spent much my name is brook good sir john i sue for yours not to charge you for i must let you understand i think myself in better plight for a lender than you are the which hath something emboldend me to this unseasoned intrusion for they say if money go before all ways do lie open troth and i have a bag of money here troubles me if you will help to bear it sir john take all or half for easing me of the carriage i will tell you sir if you will give me the hearing sir i hear you are a scholari will be brief with youand you have been a man long known to me though i had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you i shall discover a thing to you wherein i must very much lay open mine own imperfection but good sir john as you have one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded turn another into the register of your own that i may pass with a reproof the easier sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender there is a gentlewoman in this town her husbands name is ford i have long loved her and i protest to you bestowed much on her followed her with a doting observance engrossed opportunities to meet her feed every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given largely to many to know what she would have given briefly i have pursued her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all occasions but whatsoever i have merited either in my mind or in my means meed i am sure i have received none unless experience be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say this love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues never never like a fair house built on another mans ground so that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where i erected it when i have told you that i have told you all some say that though she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her now sir john here is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in your place and person generally allowed for your many warlike courtlike and learned preparations believe it for you know it there is money spend it spend it spend more spend all i have only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this fords wife use your art of wooing win her to consent to you if any man may you may as soon as any o understand my drift she dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too bright to be looked against now could i could come to her with any detection in my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves i could drive her then from the ward of her purity her reputation her marriagevow and a thousand other her defences which now are too too strongly embattled against me what say you tot sir john o good sir want no money sir john you shall want none i am blest in your acquaintance do you know ford sir i would you knew ford sir that you might avoid him if you saw him what a damned epicurean rascal is this my heart is ready to crack
