as by your high imperial majesty i had in charge at my depart for france as procurator to your excellence to marry princess margaret for your grace so in the famous ancient city tours in presence of the kings of france and sicil the dukes of orleans calaber bretagne and alencon seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops i have performd my task and was espoused and humbly now upon my bended knee in sight of england and her lordly peers deliver up my title in the queen to your most gracious hands that are the substance of that great shadow i did represent the happiest gift that ever marquess gave the fairest queen that ever king received my lord protector so it please your grace here are the articles of contracted peace between our sovereign and the french king charles for eighteen months concluded by consent how now fellow wouldst anything with me thy wife too thats some wrong indeed whats yours whats here   against the duke of suffolk for enclosing the commons of melford how now sir knave who is there   take this fellow in and send for his master with a pursuivant presently well hear more of your matter before the king madam be patient as i was cause your highness came to england so will i in england work your graces full content and he of these that can do most of all cannot do more in england than the nevils salisbury and warwick are no simple peers madam myself have limed a bush for her and placed a quire of such enticing birds that she will light to listen to the lays and never mount to trouble you again so let her rest and madam list to me for i am bold to counsel you in this although we fancy not the cardinal yet must we join with him and with the lords till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace as for the duke of york this late complaint will make but little for his benefit so one by one well weed them all at last and you yourself shall steer the happy helm resign it then and leave thine insolence since thou wert kingas who is king but thou the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck the dauphin hath prevaild beyond the seas and all the peers and nobles of the realm have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty before we make election give me leave to show some reason of no little force that york is most unmeet of any man peace headstrong warwick because here is a man accused of treason pray god the duke of york excuse himself please it your majesty this is the man that doth accuse his master of high treason his words were these that richard duke of york was rightful heir unto the english crown and that your majesty was a usurper no marvel an it like your majesty my lord protectors hawks do tower so well they know their master loves to be aloft and bears his thoughts above his falcons pitch no malice sir no more than well becomes so good a quarrel and so bad a peer why as you my lord ant like your lordly lordprotectorship come to the king and tell him what miracle what woman is this how camest thou so and yet i think jet did he never see true made the lame to leap and fly away thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays thus eleanors pride dies in her youngest days well hath your highness seen into this duke and had i first been put to speak my mind i think i should have told your graces tale the duchess by his subornation upon my life began her devilish practises or if he were not privy to those faults yet by reputing of his high descent as next the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereigns fall smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here my lord these faults are easy quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couchd as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to oerthrow his state but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death ah york no man alive so fain as i madam tis true and weret not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold who being accused a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed no let him die in that he is a fox by nature proved an enemy to the flock before his chaps be staind with crimson blood as humphrey proved by reasons to my liege and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest here is my hand the deed is worthy doing why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand a charge lord york that i will see performd but now return we to the false duke humphrey ill see it truly done my lord of york now sirs have you dispatchd this thing why thats well said go get you to my house i will reward you for this venturous deed the king and all the peers are here at hand have you laid fair the bed is all things well according as i gave directions away be gone ill call him presently my noble lord dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead he doth revive again madam be patient comfort my sovereign gracious henry comfort a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue what instance gives lord warwick for his vow why warwick who should do the duke to death myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but heres a vengeful sword rusted with ease that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murders crimson badge say if thou darest proud lord of warwickshire that i am faulty in duke humphreys death bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanor if ever lady wrongd her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutord churl and noble stock was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevils noble race thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood if from this presence thou darest go with me the traitorous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me mighty sovereign tis like the commons rude unpolishd hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employd to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king cease gentle queen these execrations and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave a plague upon them wherefore should i curse them would curses kill as doth the mandrakes groan i would invent as bittersearching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear deliverd strongly through my fixed teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as leanfaced envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fixed on end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burthend heart would break should i not curse them poison be their drink gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks their softest touch as smart as lizards sting their music frightful as the serpents hiss and boding screechowls make the concert full all the foul terrors in darkseated hell you bade me ban and will you bid me leave now by the ground that i am banishd from well could i curse away a winters night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport thus is poor suffolk ten times banished once by the king and three times thrice by thee tis not the land i care for wert thou thence a wilderness is populous enough so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art there is the world itself with every several pleasure in the world and where thou art not desolation i can no more live thou to joy thy life myself no joy in nought but that thou livest if i depart from thee i cannot live and in thy sight to die what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap here could i breathe my soul into the air as mild and gentle as the cradlebabe dying with mothers dug between its lips where from thy sight i should be raging mad and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul or i should breathe it so into thy body and then it lived in sweet elysium to die by thee were but to die in jest from thee to die were torture more than death o let me stay befall what may befall i go a jewel lockd into the wofullst cask that ever did contain a thing of worth even as a splitted bark so sunder we this way fall i to death look on my george i am a gentleman rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid thy name affrights me in whose sound is death a cunning man did calculate my birth and told me that by water i should die yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded thy name is gaultier being rightly sounded stay whitmore for thy prisoner

thou thou darest not for thy own pole o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder upon these paltry servile abject drudges small things make base men proud this villain here being captain of a pinnace threatens more than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives it is impossible that i should die by such a lowly vassal as thyself thy words move rage and not remorse in me i go of message from the queen to france i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear suffolks imperial tongue is stern and rough used to command untaught to plead for favour far be it we should honour such as these with humble suit no rather let my head stoop to the block than these knees bow to any save to the god of heaven and to my king and sooner dance upon a bloody pole than stand uncoverd to the vulgar groom true nobility is exempt from fear more can i bear than you dare execute come soldiers show what cruelty ye can that

feard thy faith what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch and beats it when it strays bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse even so remorseless have they borne him hence and as the dam runs lowing up and down looking the way her harmless young one went and can do nought but wail her darlings loss even so myself bewails good gloucesters case with sad unhelpful tears and with dimmd eyes look after him

suffolk comfort me came he right now to sing a ravens note whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers and thinks he that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the firstconceived sound hide not thy poison with such sugard words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpents sting thou baleful messenger out of my sight upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double death now gloucesters dead ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man that he is dead good warwick tis too true but how he died god knows not henry enter his chamber view his breathless corpse and comment then upon his sudden death o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphreys life if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthly image what were it but to make my sorrow greater that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence dare you be so bold why what tumultuous clamour have we here go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolks means and therefore by his majesty i swear whose far unworthy deputy i am he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer on the pain of death ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable if after three days space thou here best found on any ground that i am ruler of the world shall not be ransom for thy life come warwick come good warwick go with me i have great matters to impart to thee how fares my lord speak beaufort to thy sovereign ah what a sign it is of evil life where deaths approach is seen so terrible o thou eternal mover of the heavens look with a gentle eye upon this wretch o beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege unto this wretchs soul and from his bosom purge this black despair peace to his soul if gods good pleasure be lord cardinal if thou thinkst on heavens bliss hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him forbear to judge for we are sinners all close up his eyes and draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation lord say jack cade hath sworn to have thy head how now madam still lamenting and mourning for suffolks death i fear me love if that i had been dead thou wouldst not have mournd so much for me o graceless men they know not what they do lord say the traitors hate thee therefore away with us to killingworth come margaret god our hope will succor us farewell my lord trust not the kentish rebels why buckingham is the traitor cade surprised or is he but retired to make him strong then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates to entertain my vows of thanks and praise soldiers this day have you redeemed your lives and showd how well you love your prince and country continue still in this so good a mind and henry though he be infortunate assure yourselves will never be unkind and so with thanks and pardon to you all i do dismiss you to your several countries thus stands my state twixt cade and york distressd like to a ship that having scaped a tempest is straightway calmd and boarded with a pirate but now is cade driven back his men dispersed and now is york in arms to second him i pray thee buckingham go and meet him and ask him whats the reason of these arms tell him ill send duke edmund to the tower and somerset well commit thee thither until his army be dismissd from him in any case be not too rough in terms for he is fierce and cannot brook hard language come wife lets in and learn to govern better for yet may england curse my wretched reign buckingham doth york intend no harm to us that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm then what intends these forces thou dost bring the head of cade great god how just art thou o let me view his visage being dead that living wrought me such exceeding trouble tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him how art thou calld and what is thy degree iden kneel down   rise up a knight we give thee for reward a thousand marks and will that thou henceforth attend on us see buckingham somerset comes with the queen go bid her hide him quickly from the duke ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour makes him oppose himself against his king why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow old salisbury shame to thy silver hair thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son what wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles o where is faith o where is loyalty if it be banishd from the frosty head where shall it find a harbour in the earth wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war and shame thine honourable age with blood why art thou old and wantst experience or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it for shame in duty bend thy knee to me that bows unto the grave with mickle age hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath call buckingham and bid him arm himself can we outrun the heavens good margaret staygreat king of england and my gracious lord the mutual conference that my mind hath had by day by night waking and in my dreams in courtly company or at my beads with you mine alderliefest sovereign makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms such as my wit affords and overjoy of heart doth minister reading  to my lord protector are your supplications to his lordship let me see them what is thine my lord of suffolk say is this the guise is this the fashion in the court of england is this the government of britains isle and this the royalty of albions king what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucesters governance am i a queen in title and in style and must be made a subject to a duke i tell thee pole when in the city tours thou ranst a tilt in honour of my love and stolest away the ladies hearts of france i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness to number avemaries on his beads his champions are the prophets and apostles his weapons holy saws of sacred writ his study is his tiltyard and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope and carry him to rome and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness because the king forsooth will have it so if he be old enough what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence and thy ambition gloucester tell me good fellow camest thou here by chance or of devotion to this holy shrine it made me laugh to see the villain run gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest and look thyself be faultless thou wert best why now is henry king and margaret queen and humphrey duke of gloucester scarce himself that bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once his lady banishd and a limb loppd off this staff of honour raught there let it stand where it best fits to be in henrys hand ay good my lord for purposely therefore left i the court to see this quarrel tried can you not see or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alterd countenance with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a faroff look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars and humphrey is no little man in england first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he as the next will mount me seemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council by flattery hath he won the commons hearts and when he please to make commotion tis to be feard they all will follow him now tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted suffer them now and theyll oergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke if it be fond call it a womans fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wrongd the duke my lord of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual ah whats more dangerous than this fond affiance seems he a dove his feathers are but borrowed for hes disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb his skin is surely lent him for hes inclined as is the ravenous wolf who cannot steal a shape that means deceit take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man but i can give the loser leave to chide what will your highness leave the parliament free lords cold snow melts with the suns hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucesters show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake rolld in a flowering bank with shining chequerd slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent believe me lords were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us of the fear we have of him so the poor chicken should be sure of death and so say i nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have proved far worse than his god forbid any malice should prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman pray god he may acquit him of suspicion marry god forfend run go help help o henry ope thine eyes why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christianlike laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heartoffending groans or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive what know i how the world may deem of me for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away so shall my name with slanders tongue be wounded and princes courts be filld with my reproach this get i by his death ay me unhappy to be a queen and crownd with infamy be woe for me more wretched than he is what dost thou turn away and hide thy face i am no loathsome leper look on me what art thou like the adder waxen deaf be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen is all thy comfort shut in gloucesters tomb why then dame margaret was neer thy joy erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign was i for this nigh wreckd upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from englands bank drove back again unto my native clime what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpions nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore what did i then but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards englands blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee the prettyvaulting sea refused to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drownd on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cowerd in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnestgaping sight of thy lands view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land the sea received it and so i wishd thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair englands view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and calld them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albions wished coast how often have i tempted suffolks tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his fathers acts commenced in burning troy am i not witchd like her or thou not false like him ay me i can no more die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphreys timeless death are you the butcher suffolk wheres your knife is beaufort termd a kite where are his talons he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times fie coward woman and softhearted wretch hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy enough sweet suffolk thou tormentst thyself and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass or like an overcharged gun recoil and turn the force of them upon thyself o let me entreat thee cease give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woful monuments o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou mightst think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee so get thee gone that i may know my grief tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want i will repeal thee or be well assured adventure to be banished myself and banished i am if but from thee go speak not to me even now be gone o go not yet even thus two friends condemnd embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die yet now farewell and farewell life with thee and take my heart with thee this way for me oft have i heard that grief softens the mind and makes it fearful and degenerate think therefore on revenge and cease to weep but who can cease to weep and look on this here may his head lie on my throbbing breast but wheres the body that i should embrace ah barbarous villains hath this lovely face ruled like a wandering planet over me and could it not enforce them to relent that were unworthy to behold the same ah were the duke of suffolk now alive these kentish rebels would be soon appeased my hope is gone now suffolk is deceased for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head but boldly stand and front him to his face and here comes clifford to deny their bail he is arrested but will not obey his sons he says shall give their words for him a subtle traitor needs no sophister away my lord you are slow for shame away what are you made of youll nor fight nor fly now is it manhood wisdom and defence to give the enemy way and to secure us by what we can which can no more but fly   if you be taen we then should see the bottom of all our fortunes but if we haply scape as well we may if not through your neglect we shall to london get where you are loved and where this breach now in our fortunes made may readily be stoppdher sight did ravish but her grace in speech her words yclad with wisdoms majesty makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys such is the fulness of my hearts content lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love for my part noble lords i care not which or somerset or york alls one to me uncle what shall we say to this in law o god seest thou this and bearest so long my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though lockd up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted ill send some holy bishop to entreat for god forbid so many simple souls should perish by the sword and i myself rather than bloody war shall cut them short will parley with jack cade their general but stay ill read it over once againkneeling  long live queen margaret englands happiness come lets be gone god save your majesty he hath confessed away with him hes a villain and a traitor ay marry will we therefore get ye gone no no and therefore well

and sue to him   away base cullions suffolk let them go beside the haughty protector have we beaufort the imperious churchman somerset buckingham and grumbling york and not the least of these but can do more in england than the king not all these lords do vex me half so much as that proud dame the lord protectors wife she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies more like an empress than duke humphreys wife strangers in court do take her for the queen she bears a dukes revenues on her back and in her heart she scorns our poverty shall i not live to be avenged on her contemptuous baseborn callet as she is she vaunted mongst her minions tother day the very train of her worst wearing gown was better worth than all my fathers lands till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter they sale of offices and towns in france if they were known as the suspect is great would make thee quickly hop without thy head   give me my fan what minion can ye not   i cry you mercy madam was it you believe me lords for flying at the brook i saw not better sport these seven years day yet by your leave the wind was very high and ten to one old joan had not gone out i see no reason why a king

in france and normandy or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learned council of the realm studied so long sat in the councilhouse early and late debating to and fro how france and

doit that eer i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trialday no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i disbursed to the garrisons and never askd for restitution i say no more than truth so help me god why tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offenders tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed that bloody sin i tortured above the felon or what trespass else ah gracious lord these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancours hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exiled your highness land i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy beauforts red sparkling eyes blab his hearts malice and suffolks cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have pluckd back by false accuse doth level at my life and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirrd up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed beshrew the winners for they playd me false and

than i no sooner was i crept out of my cradle but i was made a king at nine months old was never subject longd to be a king as i do long and wish to be a subjectreads  item it is further agreed between them that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father and she sent over of the king of englands own proper cost and charges without having any dowry nephew what means this passionate discourse this peroration with such circumstance for france tis ours and we will keep it still my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king so there goes our protector in a rage tis known to you he is mine enemy nay more an enemy unto you all and no great friend i fear me to the king consider lords he is the next of blood and heir apparent to the english crown had henry got an empire by his marriage and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west theres reason he should be displeased at it look to it lords let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect what though the common people favour him calling him humphrey the good duke of gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voice jesu maintain your royal excellence with god preserve the good duke humphrey i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector this weighty business will not brook delay ill to the duke of suffolk presently ambitious warwick let thy betters speak the commons hast thou rackd the clergys bags are lank and lean with thy extortions i thought as much he would be above the clouds thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart pernicious protector dangerous peer that smoothst it so with king and commonweal let me be blessed for the peace i make against this proud protector with my sword aside to gloucester  marry when thou darest aside to gloucester  ay where thou darest not peep an if thou darest this evening on the east side of the grove believe me cousin gloucester had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly we had had more sport   come with thy twohand sword aside to gloucester  are ye advised the east side of the grove aside to gloucester  medice teipsum protector see tot well protect yourself here comes the townsmen on procession to present your highness with the man what art thou lame duke humphrey has done a miracle today aside to gloucester  and so my lord protector by this means your lady is forthcoming yet at london this news i think hath turnd your weapons edge tis like my lord you will not keep your hour did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done it serves you well my lord to say so much my liege his railing is intolerable if those that care to keep your royal person from treasons secret knife and traitors rage be thus upbraided chid and rated at and the offender granted scope of speech twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace sirs take away the duke and guard him sure that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death tis meet he be condemnd by course of law but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed and ill provide his executioner i tender so the safety of my liege a breach that craves a quick expedient stop what counsel give you in this weighty cause my lord of york try what your fortune is the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men collected choicely from each county some and try your hap against the irishmen no more of him for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more and so break off the day is almost spent lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event gods secret judgment i did dream tonight the duke was dumb and could not speak a word if thou best death ill give thee englands treasure enough to purchase such another island so thou wilt let me live and feel no pain bring me unto my trial when you will died he not in his bed where should he die can i make men live whether they will or no o torture me no more i will confess alive again then show me where he is ill give a thousand pound to look upon him he hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them comb down his hair look look it stands upright like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul give me some drink and bid the apothecary bring the strong poison that i bought of himnow by the death of him that died for all these counties were the keys of normandy but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son pride went before ambition follows him while these do labour for their own preferment behoves it us to labour for the realm i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o the church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey and brother york thy acts in ireland in bringing them to civil discipline thy late exploits done in the heart of france when thou wert regent for our sovereign have made thee feard and honourd of the people join we together for the public good in what we can to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal with somersets and buckinghams ambition and as we may cherish duke humphreys deeds while they do tend the profit of the land then lets make haste away and look unto the main peace son and show some reason buckingham why somerset should be preferred in this my lord i long to hear it at full but william of hatfield died without an heir this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king who kept him in captivity till he died but to the rest my lord break we off we know your mind at full come leave your drinking and fall to blows sirrah whats thy name peter what more thump then see thou thump thy master well to the commons entering  sirs stand apart the king shall know your mind dread lord the commons send you word by me unless lord suffolk straight be done to death or banished fair englands territories they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingering death they say by him the good duke humphrey died they say in him they fear your highness death and mere instinct of love and loyalty free from a stubborn opposite intent as being thought to contradict your liking makes them thus forward in his banishment they say in care of your most royal person that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death yet notwithstanding such a strait edict were there a serpent seen with forked tongue that slily glided towards your majesty it were but necessary you were waked lest being sufferd in that harmful slumber the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal and therefore do they cry though you forbid that they will guard you whether you will or no from such fell serpents as false suffolk is with whose envenomed and fatal sting your loving uncle twenty times his worth they say is shamefully bereft of life disturb him not let him pass peaceably my lord i have considerd with myself the title of this most renowned duke and in my conscience do repute his grace the rightful heir to englands royal seat i have it is great sin to swear unto a sin but greater sin to keep a sinful oath who can be bound by any solemn vow to do a murderous deed to rob a man to force a spotless virgins chastity to reave the orphan of his patrimony to wring the widow from her customd right and have no other reason for this wrong but that he was bound by a solemn oath now by my sword well hast thou fought today by the mass so did we all i thank you richard god knows how long it is i have to live and it hath pleased him that three times today you have defended me from imminent death well lords we have not got that which we have tis not enough our foes are this time fled being opposites of such repairing naturefor grief that they are past recovery for were there hope to conquer them again my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears anjou and maine myself did win them both those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds delivered up again with peaceful words mort dieu so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country unto the main o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win and would have kept so long as breath did last main chance father you meant but i meant maine which i will win from france or else be slain whether your grace be worthy yea or no dispute not that york is the worthier the cardinals not my better in the field warwick may live to be the best of all that can i witness and a fouler fact did never traitor in the land commit image of pride why should i hold my peace sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevils are thy subjects to command father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown what plain proceeding is more plain than this henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third till lionels issue fails his should not reign it fails not yet but flourishes in thee and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock then father salisbury kneel we together and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honour of his birthright to the crown my heart assures me that the earl of warwick shall one day make the duke of york a king it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorously is murderd by suffolk and the cardinal beauforts means the commons like an angry hive of bees that want their leader scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge myself have calmd their spleenful mutiny until they hear the order of his death that shall i do my liege stay salisbury with the rude multitude till i return come hither gracious sovereign view this body as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his fathers wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thricefamed duke see how the blood is settled in his face oft have i seen a timelyparted ghost of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless being all descended to the labouring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and neer returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again but see his face is black and full of blood his eyeballs further out than when he lived staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair upreard his nostrils stretched with struggling his hands abroad displayd as one that graspd and tuggd for life and was by strength subdued look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his wellproportiond beard made rough and rugged like to the summers corn by tempest lodged it cannot be but he was murderd here the least of all these signs were probable but both of you were vowd duke humphreys foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep tis like you would not feast him like a friend and tis well seen he found an enemy who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter who finds the partridge in the puttocks nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak even so suspicious is this tragedy what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him madam be still with reverence may i say for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereigns presence makes me mild i would false murderous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meantst that thou thyself was born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men away even now or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art ill cope with thee and do some service to duke humphreys ghost beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee see how the pangs of death do make him grin so bad a death argues a monstrous life you were best to go to bed and dream again to keep thee from the tempest of the field now by my fathers badge old nevils crest the rampant bear chaind to the ragged staff this day ill wear aloft my burgonet as on a mountain top the cedar shows that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm even to affright thee with the view thereof clifford of cumberland tis warwick calls and if thou dost not hide thee from the bear now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum and dead mens cries do fill the empty air clifford i say come forth and fight with me proud northern lord clifford of cumberland warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms   how now my noble lord what all afoot of one or both of us the time is come then nobly york tis for a crown thou fightst as i intend clifford to thrive today it grieves my soul to leave thee unassaild after them nay before them if we can now by my faith lords twas a glorious day saint albans battle won by famous york shall be eternized in all age to come sound drums and trumpets and to london all and more such days as these to us befallfor suffolks duke may he be suffocate that dims the honour of this warlike isle france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league i never read but englands kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages aside  and so says york for he hath greatest cause anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a dukes fair daughter i cannot blame them all what ist to them tis thine they give away and not their own pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans still revelling like lords till all be gone while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shared and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargaind for and sold methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnd unto the princes heart of calydon anjou and maine both given unto the french cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile englands soil a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevils parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for thats the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown then york be still awhile till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep to pry into the secrets of the state till henry surfeiting in joys of love with his new bride and englands dearbought queen and humphrey with the peers be falln at jars then will i raise aloft the milkwhite rose with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster and force perforce ill make him yield the crown whose bookish rule hath pulld fair england down if york have ill demeand himself in france then let him be denayd the regentship ill tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet first for i cannot flatter thee in pride next if i be appointed for the place my lord of somerset will keep me here without discharge money or furniture till france be won into the dauphins hands last time i danced attendance on his will till paris was besieged famishd and lost doth any one accuse york for a traitor base dunghill villain and mechanical ill have thy head for this thy traitors speech i do beseech your royal majesty let him have all the rigor of the law lay hands upon these traitors and their trash beldam i think we watchd you at an inch what madam are you there the king and commonweal are deeply indebted for this piece of pains my lord protector will i doubt it not see you well guerdond for these good deserts lord buckingham methinks you watchd her well a pretty plot well chosen to build upon now pray my lord lets see the devils writ what have we here   the duke yet lives that henry shall depose but him outlive and die a violent death why this is just aio te aeacida romanos vincere posse well to the rest tell me what fate awaits the duke of suffolk by water shall he die and take his end what shall betide the duke of somerset let him shun castles safer shall he be upon the sandy plains than where castles mounted stand come come my lords these oracles are hardly attaind and hardly understood the king is now in progress towards saint albans with him the husband of this lovely lady thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them a sorry breakfast for my lord protector at your pleasure my good lord whos within there ho   invite my lords of salisbury and warwick to sup with me tomorrow night away now my good lords of salisbury and warwick our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my title which is infallible to englands crown then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the thirds death reignd as king till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crownd by the name of henry the fourth seized on the realm deposed the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murderd traitorously which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first sons heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reignd the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claimed the crown had issue philippe a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was son to edmund langley edward the thirds fifth son by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippe sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king we thank you lords but i am not your king till i be crownd and that my sword be staind with heartblood of the house of lancaster and thats not suddenly to be performd but with advice and silent secrecy do you as i do in these dangerous days wink at the duke of suffolks insolence at beauforts pride at somersets ambition at buckingham and all the crew of them till they have snared the shepherd of the flock that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey tis that they seek and they in seeking that shall find their deaths if york can prophesy and nevil this i do assure myself richard shall live to make the earl of warwick the greatest man in england but the king lords let him go please it your majesty this is the day appointed for the combat and ready are the appellant and defendant the armourer and his man to enter the lists so please your highness to behold the fight i never saw a fellow worse bested or more afraid to fight than is the appellant the servant of this armourer my lords dispatch this knaves tongue begins to double sound trumpets alarum to the combatants take away his weapon fellow thank god and the good wine in thy masters way and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it by means whereof the towns each day revolted aside  cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stayed the soldiers pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defamed by tyranny so that by this you would not have him die tis york that hath more reason for his death but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls weret not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the kings protector and i    and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom that somerset be sent as regent thither tis meet that lucky ruler be employd witness the fortune he hath had in france no not to lose it all as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burthen of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost show me one scar characterd on thy skin mens flesh preserved so whole do seldom win what worse than nought nay then a shame take all i will my lord so please his majesty i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers for there ill ship them all for ireland now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hopest to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth the enjoying let palefaced fear keep with the meanborn man and find no harbour in a royal heart faster than springtime showers comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies well nobles well tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake who cherishd in your breasts will sting your hearts twas men i lackd and you will give them me i take it kindly and yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madmans hands whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my

grammar school and whereas before our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to be used and contrary to the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a papermill it will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no christian ear can endure to hear thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer moreover thou hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou hast hanged them when indeed only
