lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keepst hourly afflict merely thou art deaths fool for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun and yet runnst toward him still thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou bearst are nursed by baseness thourt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fearst thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou existst on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forgetst thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thourt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bears thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an afterdinners sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant whats yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even dear sir ere long ill visit you again provost a word with you hold you there farewell   provost a word with you that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriagedowry with both her combinate husband this wellseeming angelo left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in courseand now follows allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint lukes there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly o heavens what stuff is here and you good brother father what offence hath this man made you sir that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as faults from seeming free still thus and thus still worse and you i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well he does well in t it is too general a vice and severity must cure it you are pleasant sir and speak apace i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way tis not possible you do him wrong surely what i prithee might be the cause either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringingsforth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you why should he die sir no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape backwounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but who comes here bliss and goodness on you none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every days news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke what pleasure was he given to if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself peace be with you   he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by selfoffences weighing shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side how may likeness made in crimes making practise on the times to draw with idle spiders strings most ponderous and substantial things craft against vice i must apply with angelo tonight shall lie his old betrothed but despised so disguise shall by the disguised pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm i pray you tell me hath any body inquired for me here today much upon this time have i promised here to meet very well met and well come what is the news from this good deputy tis well borne up i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this what ho within come forth   i pray you be acquainted with this maid she comes to do you good take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear i shall attend your leisure but make haste the vaporous night approaches nor gentle daughter fear you not at all he is your husband on a precontract to bring you thus together tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit come let us go our corns to reap for yet our tithes to sow the best and wholesomest spirts of the night envelope you good provost who calld here of late not isabel theres some in hope and here comes claudios pardon what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so it is now apparent hath he born himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched he wants advice more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head born to angelo o deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of

many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason what would you say it may be right but you are i the wrong to speak before your time proceed this is most likely by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speakst or else thou art subornd against his honour in hateful practise first his integrity stands without blemish next it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults proper to himself if he had so offended he would have weighd thy brother by himself and not have cut him off some one hath set you on confess the truth and say by whose advice thou camest here to complain i know yould fain be gone an officer to prison with her shall we thus permit a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall on him so near us this needs must be a practise who knew of your

past fearing death than that which lives to fear make it your comfort so happy is your brother for this newmarried man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wrongd your well defended honour you must pardon for marianas sake but as he adjudged your brother being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promisebreach thereon dependent for your brothers life the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue an angelo for claudio death for death haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure then angelo thy faults thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stoopd to death and with like haste away with him it is your husband mockd you with a husband consenting to the safeguard of your honour i thought your marriage fit else imputation for that he knew you might reproach your life and choke your good to come for his possessions although by confiscation they are ours we do instate and widow you withal to buy you a better husband you do but lose your labour away with him to death   now sir to you against

divines and have all charitable preparation if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with him good even good father of whence are you what news abroad i the world one that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed justice i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other i guess not he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against us i shall sir fare you well happy return be to your royal grace my lord well do it throughly   signior lucio did not

gentlewoman denies all that you have said in very good time speak not you to him till we call upon you come sir did you set these women on to slander lord angelo they have confessed you did how know you where you are the dukes in us and we will hear you speak look you speak justly why thou unreverend and unhallowd friar ist not enough thou hast subornd these women to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth and in the witness of his proper ear to call him villain and then to glance from him to the duke himself to tax him with injustice take him hence to the rack with him well touse you joint by joint but we will know his purpose what unjust slander to the state away with him to prison such a fellow is not to be talked withal away with him to prison where is the provost away with him to prison lay bolts enough upon him let him speak no more away with those giglots too and with the other confederate companion my lord i am more amazed at his dishonour than at the strangeness of it i am sorry one so learned and so wise as you lord angelo have still appeard should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood and lack of temperd judgment afterwardalways obedient to your graces will i come to know your pleasure now good my lord let there be some more test made of my metal before so noble and so great a figure be stampd upon it yet give leave my lord that we may bring you something on the way the heavens give safety to your purposes tis so with me let us withdraw together and we may soon our satisfaction have touching that point we must not make a scarecrow of the law setting it up to fear the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not their terror tis one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall i not deny the jury passing on the prisoners life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try whats open made to justice that justice seizes what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and taket because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults but rather tell me when i that censure him do so offend let mine own judgment pattern out my death and nothing come in partial sir he must die where is the provost see that claudio be executed by nine tomorrow morning bring him his confessor let him be prepared for thats the utmost of his pilgrimage how now sir whats your name and whats the matter benefactors well what benefactors are they are they not malefactors go to what quality are they of elbow is your name why dost thou not speak elbow what are you sir this will last out a night in russia when nights are longest there ill take my leave and leave you to the hearing of the cause hoping youll find good cause to whip them all now whats the matter provost did not i tell thee yea hadst thou not order why dost thou ask again go to let that be mine do you your office or give up your place and you shall well be spared dispose of her to some more fitter place and that with speed hath he a sister well let her be admitted   see you the fornicatress be removed let have needful but not lavish means there shall be order fort stay a little while   youre welcome whats your will well whats your suit well the matter condemn the fault and not the actor of it why every faults condemnd ere it be done mine were the very cipher of a function to fine the faults whose fine stands in record and let go by the actor maiden no remedy i will not dot look what i will not that i cannot do hes sentenced tis too late pray you be gone your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words be you content fair maid it is the law not i condemn your brother were he my kinsman brother or my son it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow the law hath not been dead though it hath slept those many had not dared to do that evil if the first that did the edict infringe had answerd for his deed now tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils either new or by remissness newconceived and so in progress to be hatchd and born are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismissd offence would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another be satisfied your brother dies tomorrow be content why do you put these sayings upon me aside                  she speaks and tis such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well i will bethink me come again tomorrow how bribe me well come to me tomorrow asideamen for i am that way going to temptation where prayers cross at any time fore noon from thee even from thy virtue whats this whats this is this her fault or mine the tempter or the tempted who sins most ha not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than womans lightness having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie what dost thou or what art thou angelo dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good o let her brother live thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what ist i dream on o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigour art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite even till now when men were fond i smiled and wonderd how when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown feard and tedious yea my gravity whereinlet no man hear mei take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood lets write good angel on the devils horn tis not the devils crest   how now whos there teach her the way   o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a wellwishd king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence   how now fair maid that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what tis your brother cannot live yet may he live awhile and it may be yea ha fie these filthy vices it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one say you so then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather that the most just law now took your brothers life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath staind i talk not of your soul our compelld sins stand more for number than for accompt nay ill not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brothers life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brothers life pleased you to dot at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so craftily and thats not good thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could displayd but mark me to be received plain ill speak more gross your brother is to die and his offence is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of questionthat you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the allbuilding law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do then must your brother die were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slanderd so you seemd of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice we are all frail nay women are frail too i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are that is a woman if you be more youre none if you be one as you are well expressd by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destined livery plainly conceive i love you he shall not isabel if you give me love believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose who will believe thee isabel my unsoild name the austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i the state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow or by the affection that now guides me most ill prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false oerweighs your true in most uneven and distracted manner his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes i the morn ill call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him good night   this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings a deflowerd maid and by an eminent body that enforced the law against it but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no for my authority bears of a credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather he should have lived save that riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have taen revenge by so receiving a dishonourd life with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived a lack when once our grace we have forgot nothing goes right we would and we would not you make my bonds still greater my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice and she will speak most bitterly and strange charges she more than me this is a strange abuse lets see thy face my lord i must confess i know this woman and five years since there was some speech of marriage betwixt myself and her which was broke off partly for that her promised proportions came short of composition but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity since which time of five years i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her upon my faith and honour i did but smile till now now good my lord give me the scope of justice my patience here is touchd i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on let me have way my lord to find this practise out what can you vouch against him signior lucio is this the man that you did tell us of hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses what resists he help him lucio o my dread lord i should be guiltier than my guiltiness to think i can be undiscernible when i perceive your grace like power divine hath lookd upon my passes then good prince no longer session hold upon my shame but let my trial be mine own confession immediate sentence then and sequent death is all the grace i beg i was my lord i am sorry that such sorrow i procure and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart that i crave death more willingly than mercy tis my deserving and i do entreat itangelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to the observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touchd but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this nineteen years we have let slip even like an oergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their childrens sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum i do fear too dreadful sith twas my fault to give the people scope twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in the ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be when must he die love you the man that wrongd you there rest your partner as i hear must die tomorrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed vouchsafe a word young sister but one word might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd the evil that thou causest to be done that is thy means to live do thou but think what tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live canst thou believe thy living is a life so stinkingly depending go mend go mend nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin thou wilt prove his take him to prison officer correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit i know none can you tell me of any how should he be made then wise why no question but he was o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm youll forswear this again not of this country though my chance is now to use it for my time i am a brother of gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die i do constantly believe you the time is come even now i shall crave your forbearance a little may be i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself but shall you on your knowledge find this way are there no other tokens between you greed concerning her observance do you persuade yourself that i respect you o place and greatness millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quests upon thy doings thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dreams and rack thee in their fancies   welcome how agreed it is not my consent but my entreaty too they will then eret be long not so not so his life is paralleld even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he meald with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so hes just   now are they come   this is a gentle provost seldom when the steeled gaoler is the friend of men   how now what noise that spirits possessed with haste that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die tomorrow as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning aside  this is his pardon purchased by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offence his quick celerity when it is born in high authority when vice makes mercy mercys so extended that for the faults love is the offender friended now sir what news pray you lets hear in the delaying death the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the dukes death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardines head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amazed but this shall absolutely resolve you come away it is almost clear dawn sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart i am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you good morning to you fair and gracious daughter this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven mark what i say which you shall find by every syllable a faithful verity the duke comes home tomorrow nay dry your eyes one of our convent and his confessor gives me this instance already he hath carried notice to escalus and angelo who do prepare to meet him at the gates there to give up their power if you can pace your wisdom in that good path that i would wish it go and you shall have your bosom on this wretch grace of the duke revenges to your heart and general honour sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in them i thank thee varrius thou hast made good haste come we will walk theres other of our friends will greet us here anon my gentle varrius nay it is ten times strange you were not bid to speak i wish you now then pray you take note of it and when you have a business for yourself pray heaven you then be perfect the warrants for yourself take heed tot thats somewhat madly spoken mended again the matter proceed good friar lets hear it   do you not smile at this lord angelo o heaven the vanity of wretched fools give us some seats come cousin angelo in this ill be impartial be you judge of your own cause is this the witness friar first let her show her face and after speak are you a maid a widow then why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife this is no witness for lord angelo no you say your husband know you this woman sirrah no more i remember you sir by the sound of your voice i met you at the prison in the absence of the duke i protest i love the duke as i love myself go take her hence and marry her instantly do you the office friar which consummate return him here again go with him provost never crave him we are definitive your suits unprofitable stand up i say i have bethought me of another fault provost how came it claudio was beheaded at an unusual hour had you a special warrant for the deed whats he there was a friar told me of this man sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul that apprehends no further than this world and squarest thy life according thourt condemnd but for those earthly faults i quit them all and pray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to come friar advise him i leave him to your hand what muffled fellows that to isabella  if he be like your brother for his sake is he pardond and for your lovely sake give me your hand and say you will be mine he is my brother too but fitter time for that by this lord angelo perceives hes safe methinks i see a quickening in his eye well angelo your evil quits you well look that you love your wife her worth worth yours i find an apt remission in myself and yet heres one in place i cannot pardon   you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward one all of luxury an ass a madman wherein have i so deserved of you that you extol me thusi thank you fare you wellif the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped one out of the table ay that he razed i believe thee for i think thou never wast where grace was said in any proportion or in any language ay why not grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the list i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee behold behold where madam mitigation comes i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to judge a french crown more nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee but after all this fooling i would not have it so art thou sure of this believe me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promisekeeping away lets go learn the truth of it why how now claudio whence comes this restraint if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment whats thy offence claudio what ist murder lechery a hundred if theyll do you any good is lechery so lookd after with child perhaps i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to him i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of ticktack ill to her within two hours within  ho peace be in this place hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses proclaim you are no less can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you not to be weary with you hes in prison for that which if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child it is true i would notthough tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so i hold you as a thing enskyd and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talkd with in sincerity as with a saint do not believe it fewness and truth tis thus your brother and his lover have embraced as those that feed grow full as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry is she your cousin she it is this is the point the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givingsout were of an infinite distance from his truemeant design upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snowbroth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast heto give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lionshath pickd out an act under whose heavy sense your brothers life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and thats my pith of business twixt you and your poor brother has censured him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for his execution assay the power you have our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them but speedily i take my leave of you aside to isabella  givet not oer so to him again entreat him kneel down before him hang upon his gown you are too cold if you should need a pin you could not with more tame a tongue desire it to him i say aside to isabella  you are too cold aside to isabella ay touch him theres the vein aside to isabella           ay well said aside to isabella   thats well said aside to isabella  o to him to him wench he will relent hes coming i perceive t thourt i the right girl more o that aside to isabella  art avised o that more on t aside to isabella  you had marrd all else aside to isabella  go to tis well away how now noble pompey what at the wheels of caesar art thou led in triumph what is there none of pygmalions images newly made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutchd what reply ha what sayest thou to this tune matter and method ist not drowned i the last rain ha what sayest thou trot is the world as it was man which is the way is it sad and few words or how the trick of it how doth my dear morsel thy mistress procures she still ha why tis good it is the right of it it must be so ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd an unshunned consequence it must be so art going to prison pompey why tis not amiss pompey farewell go say i sent thee thither for debt pompey or how well then imprison him if

he is in rome but where is he think you it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to t a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think you some report a seamaid spawned him some that he was begot between two stockfishes but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a motion generative thats infallible why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man would the duke that is absent have done this ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy o sir you are deceived who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish the duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too that let me inform you sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow sir i know him and i love him come sir i know what i know sir my name is lucio well known to the duke i fear you not ill be hanged first thou art deceived in me

province with continency sparrows must not build in his houseeaves because they are lecherous the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays hes not past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that i said so farewell good even friar wheres the provost o pretty isabella i am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red thou must be patient i am fain to dine and sup with water and bran i dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to t but they say the duke will be here tomorrow by my troth isabel i

bed you know the lady she is fast my wife save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order this we came not to only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet unhappily even so and the new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his emmence that fills it up i stagger inbut this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscourd armour hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me tis surely for a name i have done so but hes not to be found i prithee lucio do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as move men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade i thank you good friend lucio come officer away the miserable have no other medicine but only hope ive hope to live and am prepared to die i humbly thank you to sue to live i find i seek to die and seeking death find life let it come on most holy sir i thank you now sister whats the comfort is there no remedy but is there any perpetual durance but in what nature let me know the point why give you me this shame think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms the prenzie angelo o heavens it cannot be thou shalt not dot thanks dear isabel yes has he affections in him that thus can make him bite the law by the nose when he would force it sure it is no sin or of the deadly seven it is the least if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined o isabel death is a fearful thing ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling region of thickribbed ice to be imprisond in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling tis too horrible the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death sweet sister let me live what sin you do to save a brothers life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue nay hear me isabel o hear me isabella let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it as fast lockd up in sleep as guiltless labour when it lies starkly in the travellers bones he will not wakei do it not in evil disposition but from lord angelo by special charge away sir you must go here if it like your honour pray you do   ill know his pleasure may be he will relent alas he hath but as offended in a dream all sects all ages smack of this vice and he to die fort is it your will claudio shall die tomorrow lest i might be too rash under your good correction i have seen when after execution judgment hath repented oer his doom i crave your honours pardon what shall be done sir with the groaning juliet shes very near her hour ay my good lord a very virtuous maid and to be shortly of a sisterhood if not already god save your honour aside  heaven give thee moving graces aside  pray heaven she win him i am the provost whats your will good friar i would do more than that if more were needful   look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blisterd her report she is with child and he that got it sentenced a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this as i do think tomorrow i have provided for you stay awhile   and you shall be conducted tis pity of him whos there come in the wish deserves a welcome and very welcome look signior heres your sister as many as you please whats

can you cut off a mans head come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer tomorrow morning are to die claudio and barnardine here is in our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been a notorious bawd what ho abhorson wheres abhorson there sirrah heres a fellow will help you tomorrow in your execution if you think it meet compound with him by the year and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present and dismiss him he cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale are you agreed you sirrah provide your block and your axe tomorrow four oclock call hither barnardine and claudio   the one has my pity not a jot the other being a murderer though he were my brother   look heres the warrant claudio for thy death tis now dead midnight and by eight tomorrow thou must be made immortal wheres barnardine who can do good on him well go prepare yourself   but hark what noise heaven give your spirits comfort   by and by i hope it is some pardon or reprieve for the most gentle claudio   welcome father none since the curfew rung no what comfort is for claudio it is a bitter deputy there he must stay until the officer arise to let him in he is calld up none sir none happily you something know yet i believe there comes no countermand no such example have we besides upon the very siege of justice lord angelo hath to the public ear professd the contrary   this is his lordships man i shall obey him i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before reads whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon barnardine for my better satisfaction let me have claudios head sent me by five let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril what say you to this sir a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof most manifest and not denied by himself a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all pray sir in what a lack how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo i may make my case as claudios to cross this in the smallest angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour pardon me good father it is against my oath to him and to his substitutes but what likelihood is in that i know them both now sir how do you find the prisoner here in the prison father there died this morning of a cruel fever one ragozine a most notorious pirate a man of claudios years his beard and head just of his colour what if we do omit this reprobate till he were well inclined and satisfy the deputy with the visage of ragozine more like to claudio this shall be done good father presently but barnardine must die this afternoon and how shall we continue claudio to save me from the danger that might come if he were known alive i am your free dependant here is the head ill carry it myself ill make all speed it was commanded so no my good lord it was by private message pardon me noble lord i thought it was a fault but knew it not yet did repent me after more advice for testimony whereof one in the prison that should by private order else have died i have reserved alive his name is barnardine this my lord this is another prisoner that i saved who should have died when claudio lost his head as like almost to claudio as himselfmay your grace speak of it gladly my lord it rested in your grace to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased and it in you more dreadful would have seemd than in lord angeloand have you nuns no farther privileges yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare whos that which calls peace and prosperity who ist that calls why her unhappy brother let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister woe me for what sir make me not your story you do blaspheme the good in mocking me some one with child by him my cousin juliet adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names by vain though apt affection o let him marry her doth he so seek his life alas what poor abilitys in me to do him good my power alas i doubt ill see what i can do i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night ill send him certain word of my success good sir adieu i am a woeful suitor to your honour please but your honour hear me there is a vice that most i do abhor and most desire should meet the blow of justice for which i would not plead but that i must for which i must not plead but that i am at war twixt will and will not i have a brother is condemnd to die i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother o just but severe law i had a brother then heaven keep your honour must he needs die yes i do think that you might pardon him and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy but can you if you would but might you dot and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touchd with that remorse a s mine is to him too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the kings crown nor the deputed sword the marshals truncheon nor the judges robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipt like him but he like you would not have been so stern i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel should it then be thus no i would tell what twere to be a judge and what a prisoner alas alas why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made tomorrow o thats sudden spare him spare him hes not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offence theres many have committed it yet show some pity so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would neer be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splitst the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man drest in a little brief authority most ignorant of what hes most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal we cannot weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation that in the captains but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know thats like my brothers fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brothers life gentle my lord turn back hark how ill bribe you good my lord turn back ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you not with fond shekels of the tested gold or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal heaven keep your honour safe at what hour tomorrow shall i attend your lordship save your honour i am come to know your pleasure even so heaven keep your honour under your sentence when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not tis set down so in heaven but not in earth sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul how say you please you to dot ill take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin ill make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better so true as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips ild wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere ild yield my body up to shame and twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it i know your virtue hath a licence int which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others ha little honour to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look fort sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretchd throat ill tell the world aloud what man thou art to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make courtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to the appetite to follow as it draws ill to my brother though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks held yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorrd pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity ill tell him yet of angelos request and fit his mind to death for his souls rest within  what ho peace here grace and good company my business is a word or two with claudio why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed tomorrow you set on none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if youll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the worlds vastidity you had to a determined scope in such a one as you consenting tot would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour darest thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies there spake my brother there my fathers grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outwardsainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell o tis the cunning livery of hell the damnedst body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed yes he would givet thee from this rank offence so to offend him still this nights the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest tomorrow o were it but my life ild throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin be ready claudio for your death tomorrow which is the least what says my brother and shamed life a hateful alas alas o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice ist not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sisters shame what should i think heaven shield my mother playd my father fair for such a warped slip of wilderness neer issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee o fie fie fie thy sins not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd tis best thou diest quickly what is your will i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name can this be so did angelo so leave her what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail show me how good father the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father he hath a garden circummured with brick whose western side is with a vineyard backd and to that vineyard is a planched gate that makes his opening with this bigger key this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads there have i made my promise upon the heavy middle of the night to call upon him i have taen a due and wary note upont with whispering and most guilty diligence in action all of precept he did show me the way twice oer no none but only a repair i the dark and that i have possessd him my most stay can be but brief for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along that stays upon me whose persuasion is i come about my brother i do desire the like shell take the enterprise upon her father if you advise it little have you to say when you depart from him but soft and low remember now my brother within  peace ho be here ho by your leave the better given me by so holy a man hath yet the deputy sent my brothers pardon nay but it is not so o i will to him and pluck out his eyes unhappy claudio wretched isabel injurious world most damned angelo i am directed by you to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part yet i am advised to do it he says to veil full purpose besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for tis a physic thats bitter to sweet end o peace the friar is come justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wrongd i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here by course of justice most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelos forsworn is it not strange that angelos a murderer is t not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virginviolator is it not strange and strange it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to the end of reckoning o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touchd with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike tis not impossible but one the wickedst caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an archvillain believe it royal prince if he be less hes nothing but hes more had i more name for badness o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true i am the sister of one claudio condemnd upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemnd by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger thats he indeed this gentleman told somewhat of my tale i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy pardon it the phrase is to the matter in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i prayd and kneeld how he refelld me and how i replied for this was of much lengththe vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brothers head o that it were as like as it is true and is this all then o you blessed ministers above keep me in patience and with ripend time unfold the evil which is here wrapt up in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wrongd hence unbelieved go one that i would were here friar lodowick o give me pardon that i your vassal have employd and paind your unknown sovereignty i do my lord most bounteous sir   look if it please you on this man condemnd as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity governd his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not oertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perishd by the way thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughtsare not these large enough it is a mans voice gentle isabella turn you the key and know his business of him you may i may not you are yet unsworn when you have vowd you must not speak with men but in the
