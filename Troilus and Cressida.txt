call here my varlet ill unarm again why should i war without the walls of troy that find such cruel battle here within each trojan that is master of his heart let him to field troilus alas hath none the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant but i am weaker than a womans tear tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance less valiant than the virgin in the night and skilless as unpractised infancy have i not tarried have i not tarried still have i tarried patience herself what goddess eer she be doth lesser blench at sufferance than i do at priams royal table do i sit and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts so traitor when she comes when is she thence i was about to tell theewhen my heart as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain lest hector or my father should perceive me i have as when the sun doth light a storm buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile but sorrow that is couchd in seeming gladness is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness o pandarus i tell thee pandarus when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drownd reply not in how many fathoms deep they lie indrenchd i tell thee i am mad in cressids love thou answerst she is fair pourst in the open ulcer of my heart her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice handlest in thy discourse o that her hand in whose comparison all whites are ink writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure the cygnets down is harsh and spirit of sense hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tellst me as true thou tellst me when i say i love her but saying thus instead of oil and balm thou layst in every gash that love hath given me the knife that made it thou dost not speak so much good pandarus how now pandarus what art thou angry pandarus what with me say i she is not fair pandarus sweet pandarus peace you ungracious clamours peace rude sounds fools on both sides helen must needs be fair when with your blood you daily paint her thus i cannot fight upon this argument it is too starved a subject for my sword but pandaruso gods how do you plague me i cannot come to cressid but by pandar and hes as tetchy to be wood to woo as she is stubbornchaste against all suit tell me apollo for thy daphnes love what cressid is what pandar and what we her bed is india there she lies a pearl between our ilium and where she resides let it be calld the wild and wandering flood ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark because not there this womans answer sorts for womanish it is to be from thence what news aeneas from the field today by whom aeneas let paris bleed tis but a scar to scorn paris is gored with menelaus horn better at home if would i might were may but to the sport abroad are you bound thither come go we then together fie fie my brother weigh you the worth and honour of a king so great as our dread father in a scale of common ounces will you with counters sum the past proportion of his infinite and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons fie for godly shame you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest you fur your gloves with reason here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm you know a sword employd is perilous and reason flies the object of all harm who marvels then when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove or like a star disorbd nay if we talk of reason lets shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour should have harehearts would they but fat their thoughts with this crammd reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject what is aught but as tis valued i take today a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores of will and judgment how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elected the wife i chose there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honour we turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soild them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath of full consent bellied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service he touchd the ports desired and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollos and makes stale the morning why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping why she is a pearl whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships and turnd crownd kings to merchants if youll avouch twas wisdom paris went as you must needs for you all cried go go if youll confess he brought home noble prize as you must needs for you all clappd your hands and cried inestimablewhy do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate and do a deed that fortune never did beggar the estimation which you prized richer than sea and land o theft most base that we have stoln what we do fear to keep but thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln that in their country did them that disgrace we fear to warrant in our native place tis our mad sister i do know her voice why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandras mad her brainsick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engaged to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touchd than all priams sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain why there you touchd the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide worlds revenue sirrah walk off no pandarus i stalk about her door like a strange soul upon the stygian banks staying for waftage o be thou my charon and give me swift transportance to those fields where i may wallow in the lilybeds proposed for the deserver o gentle pandarus from cupids shoulder pluck his painted wings and fly with me to cressid i am giddy expectation whirls me round the imaginary relish is so sweet that it enchants my sense what will it be when that the watery palate tastes indeed loves thrice repured nectar death i fear me swooning destruction or some joy too fine too subtlepotent tuned too sharp in sweetness for the capacity of my ruder powers i fear it much and i do fear besides that i shall lose distinction in my joys as doth a battle when they charge on heaps the enemy flying even such a passion doth embrace my bosom my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse and all my powers do their bestowing lose like vassalage at unawares encountering the eye of majesty you have bereft me of all words lady o cressida how often have i wished me thus what should they grant what makes this pretty abruption what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupids pageant there is presented no monster nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confined that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit are there such such are not we praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus you know now your hostages your uncles word and my firm faith why was my cressid then so hard to win and shall albeit sweet music issues thence your leave sweet cressid what offends you lady you cannot shun yourself well know they what they speak that speak so wisely o that i thought it could be in a woman as if it can i will presume in you to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beautys outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowd purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truths simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare want similes truth tired with iteration as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to the centre yet after all comparisons of truth as truths authentic author to be cited as true as troilus shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers amen dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold trouble him not to bed to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants empty of all thought i prithee now to bed o cressida but that the busy day waked by the lark hath roused the ribald crows and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer i would not from thee beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love with wings more momentaryswift than thought you will catch cold and curse me it is your uncle ha ha how now whats the matter is it so concluded how my achievements mock me i will go meet them and my lord aeneas we met by chance you did not find me here walk into her house ill bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her think it an altar and thy brother troilus a priest there offering to it his own heart cressid i love thee in so straind a purity that the blessd gods as angry with my fancy more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me a hateful truth from troy and troilus and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leavetaking justles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own labouring breath we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one injurious time now with a robbers haste crams his rich thievery up he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consignd kisses to them he fumbles up into a lose adieu and scants us with a single famishd kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears hark you are calld some say the genius so cries come to him that instantly must die bid them have patience she shall come anon no remedy hear me my love be thou but true of heart nay we must use expostulation kindly for it is parting from us i speak not be thou true as fearing thee for i will throw my glove to death himself that theres no maculation in thy heart but be thou true say i to fashion in my sequent protestation be thou true and i will see thee and ill grow friend with danger wear this sleeve i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation but yet be true hear while i speak it love the grecian youths are full of quality theyre loving well composed with gifts of nature flowing and swelling oer with arts and exercise how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy which i beseech you call a virtuous sin makes me afeard die i a villain then in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted no but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency come kiss and let us part good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you who i alas it is my vice my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare fear not my truth the moral of my wit is plain and true theres all the reach of it   welcome sir diomed here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port lord ill give her to thy hand and by the way possess thee what she is entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek if eer thou stand at mercy of my sword name cressida and thy life shall be as safe as priam is in ilion grecian thou dost not use me courteously to shame the zeal of my petition to thee in praising her i tell thee lord of greece she is as far highsoaring oer thy praises as thou unworthy to be calld her servant i charge thee use her well even for my charge for by the dreadful pluto if thou dost not though the great bulk achilles be thy guard ill cut thy throat come to the port ill tell thee diomed this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head lady give me your hand and as we walk to our own selves bend we our needful talk hector thou sleepst awake thee my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you in what place of the field doth calchas keep shall sweet lord be bound to you so much after we part from agamemnons tent to bring me thither o sir to such as boasting show their scars a mock is due will you walk on my lord she was beloved she loved she is and doth but still sweet love is food for fortunes tooth sweet sir you honour me cressid comes forth to him yea so familiar what should she remember hold patience thy better must o plague and madness behold i pray you i pray thee stay i pray you stay by hell and all hells torments i will not speak a word doth that grieve thee o witherd truth by jove i will be patient she strokes his cheek nay stay by jove i will not speak a word there is between my will and all offences a guard of patience stay a little while fear me not sweet lord i will not be myself nor have cognition of what i feel i am all patience o beauty where is thy faith i will be patient outwardly i will i did swear patience wert thou the devil and worest it on thy horn it should be challenged it is to make a recordation to my soul of every syllable that here was spoke but if i tell how these two did coact shall i not lie in publishing a truth sith yet there is a credence in my heart an esperance so obstinately strong that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears as if those organs had deceptious functions created only to calumniate was cressid here she was not sure why my negation hath no taste of madness let it not be believed for womanhood think we had mothers do not give advantage to stubborn critics apt without a theme for depravation to square the general sex by cressids rule rather think this not cressid nothing at all unless that this were she this she no this is diomeds cressida if beauty have a soul this is not she if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies if sanctimony be the gods delight if there be rule in unity itself this is not she o madness of discourse that cause sets up with and against itself bifold authority where reason can revolt without perdition and loss assume all reason without revolt this is and is not cressid within my soul there doth conduce a fight of this strange nature that a thing inseparate divides more wider than the sky and earth and yet the spacious breadth of this division admits no orifex for a point as subtle as ariachnes broken woof to enter instance o instance strong as plutos gates cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven instance o instance strong as heaven itself the bonds of heaven are slippd dissolved and loosed and with another knot fivefingertied the fractions of her faith orts of her love the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics of her oereaten faith are bound to diomed ay greek and that shall be divulged well in characters as red as mars his heart inflamed with venus never did young man fancy with so eternal and so fixd a soul hark greek as much as i do cressid love so much by weight hate i her diomed that sleeve is mine that hell bear on his helm were it a casque composed by vulcans skill my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout which shipmen do the hurricano call constringed in mass by the almighty sun shall dizzy with more clamour neptunes ear in his descent than shall my prompted sword falling on diomed o cressid o false cressid false false false let all untruths stand by thy stained name and theyll seem glorious have with you prince my courteous lord adieu farewell revolted fair and diomed stand fast and wear a castle on thy head accept distracted thanks brother you have a vice of mercy in you which better fits a lion than a man when many times the captive grecian falls even in the fan and wind of your fair sword you bid them rise and live fools play by heaven hector for the love of all the gods lets leave the hermit pity with our mothers and when we have our armours buckled on the venomd vengeance ride upon our swords spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth hector then tis wars who should withhold me not fate obedience nor the hand of mars beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire not priamus and hecuba on knees their eyes oergalled with recourse of tears not you my brother with your true sword drawn opposed to  hinder me should stop my way but by my ruin this foolish dreaming superstitious girl makes all these bodements away away they are at it hark proud diomed believe i come to lose my arm or win my sleeve what now let me read words words mere words no matter from the heart the effect doth operate another way   go wind to wind there turn and change together my love with words and errors still she feeds but edifies another with her deeds fly not for shouldst thou take the river styx i would swim after o traitor diomed turn thy false face thou traitor and pay thy life thou owest me for my horse come both you cogging greeks have at you both ajax hath taen aeneas shall it be no by the flame of yonder

in all swift haste is this great agamemnons tent i pray you may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly ears fair leave and large security how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus which is that god in office guiding men which is the high and mighty agamemnon courtiers as free as debonair unarmd as bending angels thats their fame in peace but when they would seem soldiers they have galls good arms strong joints true swords and joves accord nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips the worthiness of praise distains his worth if that the praised himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends that breath fame blows that praise sole sure transcends ay greek that is my name sir pardon tis for agamemnons ears nor i from troy come not to whisper him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents and every greek of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud   we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince calld hectorpriam is his father who in this dull and longcontinued truce is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords if there be one among the fairst of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valour and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hersto him this challenge hector in view of trojans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did compass in his arms and will tomorrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector shall honour him if none hell say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth is the prince there in person had i so good occasion to lie long as you prince paris nothing but heavenly business should rob my bedmate of my company health to you valiant sir during all question of the gentle truce but when i meet you armd as black defiance as heart can think

why paris hath colour enough then troilus should have too much if she praised him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion i had as lief helens golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose then shes a merry greek indeed indeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total is he so young a man and so old a lifter juno have mercy how came it cloven o he smiles valiantly o yes an twere a cloud in autumn troilus will stand to the proof if youll prove it so if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i the shell without the rack alas poor chin many a wart is richer with millstones but there was more temperate fire under the pot of

this fault in us i find the error of our eye directs our mind what error leads must err o then conclude minds swayd by eyes are full of turpitudequeen hecuba and helen up to the eastern tower whose height commands as subject all the vale to see the battle hector whose patience is as a virtue fixd today was moved he chid andromache and struck his armourer and like as there were husbandry in war before the sun rose he was harnessd light and to the field goes he where every flower did as a prophet weep what it foresaw in hectors wrath the noise goes this there is among the greeks a lord of trojan blood nephew to hector they call him ajax they say he is a very man per se and stands alone this man lady hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly his folly sauced with discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use or purblind argus all eyes and no sight they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept hector fasting and waking madam your uncle pandarus as may be in the world ladysir my lord would instantly speak with you at your own house there he unarms him no sir he stays for you to conduct him thitherprinces what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest reard as knots by the conflux of meeting sap infect the sound pine and divert his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth nor princes is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand sith every action that hath gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bias and thwart not answering the aim and that unbodied figure of the thought that gavet surmised shape why then you princes do you with cheeks abashd behold our works and call them shames which are indeed nought else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men the fineness of which metal is not found in fortunes love for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affined and kin but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled speak prince of ithaca and bet of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lips than we are confident when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle the nature of the sickness found ulysses what is the remedy what trumpet look menelaus what would you fore our tent even this with surety stronger than achilles arm fore all the greekish heads which with one voice call agamemnon head and general how this trojan scorns us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas whats your affair i pray you he hears naught privately that comes from troy speak frankly as the wind it is not agamemnons sleeping hour that thou shalt know trojan he is awake he tells thee so himself this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love if then one is or hath or means to be that one meets hector if none else i am he fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you sir achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe where is achilles let it be known to him that we are here he shent our messengers and we lay by our appertainments visiting of him let him be told so lest perchance he think we dare not move the question of our place or know not what we are hear you patroclus we are too well acquainted with these answers but his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn cannot outfly our apprehensions much attribute he hath and much the reason why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues not virtuously on his own part beheld do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish are like to rot untasted go and tell him we come to speak with him and you shall not sin if you do say we think him overproud and underhonest in selfassumption greater than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on disguise the holy strength of their command and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance yea watch his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if the passage and whole carriage of this action rode on his tide go tell him this and add that if he overhold his price so much well none of him but let him like an engine not portable lie under this report bring action hither this cannot go to war a stirring dwarf we do allowance give before a sleeping giant tell him so in second voice well not be satisfied we come to speak with him ulysses enter you no more than what he thinks he is no question no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the fairer he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise whats his excuse why will he not upon our fair request untent his person and share the air with us let ajax go to him dear lord go you and greet him in his tent tis said he holds you well and will be led at your request a little from himself o no you shall not go he will be the physician that should be the patient go we to council let achilles sleep light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep what wouldst thou of us trojan make demand let diomedes bear him and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have what he requests of us good diomed furnish you fairly for this interchange withal bring word if hector will tomorrow be answerd in his challenge ajax is ready well execute your purpose and put on a form of strangeness as we pass along so do each lord and either greet him not or else disdainfully which shall shake him more than if not lookd on i will lead the way what says achilles would he aught with us the better here art thou in appointment fresh and fair anticipating time with starting courage give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy thou dreadful ajax that the appalled air may pierce the head of the great combatant and hale him hither is not yond diomed with calchas daughter is this the lady cressid most dearly welcome to the greeks sweet lady yonder comes the troop which way would hector have it here is sir diomed go gentle knight stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas consent upon the order of their fight so be it either to the uttermost or else a breath the combatants being kin half stints their strife before their strokes begin what trojan is that same that looks so heavy they are in action his blows are well disposed there ajax worthy of arms as welcome as to one that would be rid of such an enemy but thats no welcome understand more clear whats past and whats to come is strewd with husks and formless ruin of oblivion but in this extant moment faith and troth straind purely from all hollow biasdrawing bids thee with most divine integrity from heart of very heart great hector welcome to troilus  my wellfamed lord of troy no less to you first all you peers of greece go to my tent there in the full convive we afterwards as hectors leisure and your bounties shall concur together severally entreat him beat loud the tabourines let the trumpets blow that this great soldier may his welcome know we go wrong we go wrong so now fair prince of troy i bid good night ajax commands the guard to tend on you good night renew renew the fierce polydamas hath beat down menon bastard margarelon hath doreus prisoner and stands colossuswise waving his beam upon the pashed corses of the kings epistrophus and cedius polyxenes is slain amphimachus and thoas deadly hurt patroclus taen or slain and palamedes sore hurt and bruised the dreadful sagittary appals our numbers haste we diomed to reinforcement or we perish all hark hark what shout is that march patiently along let one be sent to pray achilles see us at our tent if in his death the gods have us befriended great troy is ours and our sharp wars are endedwith due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus horse wheres then the saucy boat whose weak untimberd sides but even now corivalld greatness either to harbour fled or made a toast for neptune even so doth valours show and valours worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize and with an accent tuned in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune most wisely hath ulysses here discoverd the fever whereof all our power is sick and in the imitation of these twain who as ulysses says opinion crowns with an imperial voicemany are infect ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him makes factious feasts rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and sets thersites a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger let this be granted and achilles horse makes many thetis sons tell him of nestor one that was a man when hectors grandsire suckd he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this witherd brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood ill prove this truth with my three drops of blood what says ulysses what ist well and how the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libyathough apollo knows tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment ay with celerity find hectors purpose pointing on him yes tis most meet whom may you else oppose that can from hector bring his honour off if not achilles thought be a sportful combat yet in the trial much opinion dwells for here the trojans taste our dearst repute with their finest palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly poised in this wild action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large it is supposed he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as twere from us all a man distilld out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence the conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves which entertaind limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs i see them not with my old eyes what are they ulysses now i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste of it forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone what moves ajax thus to bay at him who thersites then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument all the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite no achilles with him yet he loves himself ist not strange aside to diomedes  o this is well he rubs the vein of him how he describes himself an twould yould carry half hes not yet through warm force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dry our noble general do not do so wherefore should you so he is not emulous as achilles is what a vice were it in ajax now ay my good son would you my lord aught with the general nothing my lord our general doth salute you with a kiss and very courtly counsel ill begin so much for nestor a woman of quick sense now ajax hold thine own i have thou gallant trojan seen thee oft labouring for destiny make cruel way through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed despising many forfeits and subduements when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i the air not letting it decline on the declined that i have said to some my standers by lo jupiter is yonder dealing life and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath when that a ring of greeks have hemmd thee in like an olympian wrestling this have i seen but this thy countenance still lockd in steel i never saw till now i knew thy grandsire and once fought with him he was a soldier good but by great mars the captain of us all never saw like thee let an old man embrace thee and worthy warrior welcome to our tents i would my arms could match thee in contention as they contend with thee in courtesy ha by this white beard ild fight with thee tomorrow well welcome welcome i have seen the time go bear patroclus body to achilles and bid the snailpaced ajax arm for shame there is a thousand hectors in the field now here he fights on galathe his horse and there lacks work anon hes there afoot and there they fly or die like scaled sculls before the belching whale then is he yonder and there the strawy greeks ripe for his edge fall down before him like the mowers swath here there and every where he leaves and takes dexterity so obeying appetite that what he will he does and does so much that proof is calld impossibility so so we draw together peace drums   achilles achilles hectors slain achillesagamemnon thou great commander nerve and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only spirit in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up hear what ulysses speaks besides the applause and approbation to which   most mighty for thy place and sway   and thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life i give to both your speeches which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatchd in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axletree on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears to his experienced tongue yet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hectors sword had lackd a master but for these instances the specialty of rule hath been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected degree being vizarded the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask the heavens themselves the planets and this centre observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphered amidst the other whose medicinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil and posts like the commandment of a king sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixure o when degree is shaked which is the ladder to all high designs then enterprise is sick how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogenitive and due of birth prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows each thing meets in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice resides should lose their names and so should justice too then every thing includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb the generals disdaind by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and awkward action which slanderer he imitation calls he pageants us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks tis like a chime amending with terms unsquared which from the tongue of roaring typhon droppd would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his pressd bed lolling from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause cries excellent tis agamemnon just now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being drest to some oration thats done as near as the extremest ends of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent tis nestor right now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsyfumbling on his gorget shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus or give me ribs of steel i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemies weight why this hath not a fingers dignity they call this bedwork mappery closetwar so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swing and rudeness of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution amen nestor i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape this tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be croppd or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles and wake him to the answer think you give pardon to my speech therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants show our foulest wares and think perchance theyll sell if not the lustre of the better yet to show shall show the better do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honour and our shame in this are doggd with two strange followers what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent a nd we were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foild why then we did our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lottery and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off well dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men but hit or miss our projects life this shape of sense assumes ajax employd plucks down achilles plumes we saw him at the opening of his tent he is not sick achilles hath inveigled his fool from him he no you see he is his argument that has his argument achilles the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie here comes patroclus the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure achilles will not to the field tomorrow he doth rely on none but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any in will peculiar and in selfadmission things small as nothing for requests sake only he makes important possessd he is with greatness and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at selfbreath imagined worth holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse that twixt his mental and his active parts kingdomd achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself what should i say he is so plaguy proud that the deathtokens of it cry no recovery o agamemnon let it not be so well consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts save such as do revolve and ruminate himself shall he be worshippd of that we hold an idol more than he no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord must not so stale his palm nobly acquired nor by my will assubjugate his merit as amply titled as achilles is by going to achilles that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion this lord go to him jupiter forbid and say in thunder achilles go to him not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel the raven chides blackness wit would be out of fashion a would have ten shares to agamemnon  my lord you feed too much on this dislike why tis this naming of him does him harm here is a manbut tis before his face i will be silent know the whole world he is as valiant if he were proud ay or surly borne thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure praise him that got thee she that gave thee suck famed be thy tutor and thy parts of nature thrice famed beyond all erudition but he that disciplined thy arms to fight let mars divide eternity in twain and give him half and for thy vigour bullbearing milo his addition yield to sinewy ajax i will not praise thy wisdom which like a bourn a pale a shore confines thy spacious and dilated parts heres nestor instructed by the antiquary times he must he is he cannot but be wise put pardon father nestor were your days as green as ajax and your brain so temperd you should not have the eminence of him but be as ajax there is no tarrying here the hart achilles keeps thicket please it our great general to call together all his state of war fresh kings are come to troy tomorrow we must with all our main of power stand fast and heres a lordcome knights from east to west and cull their flower ajax shall cope the best achilles stands i the entrance of his tent please it our general to pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last tis like hell question me why such unplausive eyes are bent on him if so i have derision medicinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink it may be good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud mans fees now great thetis son a strange fellow here writes me that man how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver i do not strain at the position it is familiarbut at the authors drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of any thing though in and of him there be much consisting till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formd in the applause where theyre extended who like an arch reverberates the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat  i was much wrapt in this and apprehended here immediately the unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow an act that very chance doth throw upon him ajax renownd o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortunes hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into anothers pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lordswhy even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hectors breast and great troy shrieking time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a greatsized monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devourd as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honour bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mockery take the instant way for honour travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or hedge aside from the direct forthright like to an enterd tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse falln in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear oerrun and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must oertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand and with his arms outstretchd as he would fly grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing o let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigour of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise newborn gawds though they are made and moulded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt oerdusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what not stirs the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction but gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priams daughters is that a wonder the providence thats in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus gold finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps keeps place with thought and almost like the gods does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mysterywith whom relation durst never meddlein the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our islands sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hectors sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides oer the ice that you should break no trumpet answers tis he i ken the manner of his gait he rises on the toe that spirit of his in aspiration lifts him from the earth yet is the kindness but particular twere better she were kissd in general o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns for which we lose our heads to gild his horns it were no match your nail against his horn may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you i do desire it why then for venus sake give me a kiss when helen is a maid again and his nevers my day and then a kiss of you fie fie upon her theres language in her eye her cheek her lip nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motive of her body o these encounterers so glib of tongue that give accosting welcome ere it comes and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts to every ticklish reader set them down for sluttish spoils of opportunity and daughters of the game they are opposed already the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calmd his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty nor dignifies an impure thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilion thus translate him to me i wonder now how yonder city stands when we have here her base and pillar by us sir i foretold you then what would ensue my prophecy is but

half attachd with that which here his passion doth express o contain yourself your passion draws ears hither ill bring you to the gates o courage courage princes great achilles is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance patroclus wounds have roused his drowsy blood together with his mangled myrmidons that noseless handless hackd and chippd come to him crying on hector ajax hath lost a friend and foams at mouth and he is armd and at it roaring for troilus who hath done today mad and fantastic execution engaging and redeeming of himself with such a careless force and forceless care as if

success as seld i have the chancei would desire my famous cousin to our grecian tents great agamemnon comes to meet us here do not chafe thee cousin and you achilles let these threats alone till accident or purpose bring you tot you may have every day enough of hector if you have stomach the general state i fear can scarce entreat you to be odd with him no yonder tis there where we see the lights no not a whit troilus thou coward troilus troilus thou coward troilus show thy head what wouldst thou were i the general thou shouldst have my office ere that correction troilus i say what troilus ill fight with him alone stand diomed if it be so yet bragless let it be great hector was a man as good as heagamemnon how if he had boils full all over generally and those boils did run say so did not the general run then were not that a botchy core then would come some matter from him i see none now the plague of greece upon thee thou mongrel beefwitted lord i shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but i think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book thou canst strike canst thou a red murrain o thy jades tricks dost thou think i have no sense thou strikest me thus thou art proclaimed a fool i think i would thou didst itch from head to foot and i had the scratching of thee i would make thee the loathsomest scab in greece when thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at proserpines beauty ay that thou barkest at him thou shouldest strike him he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit do do ay do do thou soddenwitted lord thou hast no more brain than i have in mine elbows an assinego may tutor thee thou scurvyvaliant ass thou art here but to thrash trojans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave if thou use to beat me i will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou you scurvy lord mars his idiot do rudeness do camel do do you see him there do you nay look upon him nay but regard him well but yet you look not well upon him for whosoever you take him to be he is ajax ay but that fool knows not himself lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters his evasions have ears thus long i have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones i will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the nineth part of a sparrow this lord achilles ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head ill tell you what i say of him i say this ajax has not so much wit as will stop the eye of helens needle for whom he comes to fight i would have peace and quietness but the fool will not he there that he look you there no i warrant you for a fools will shame it i serve thee not i serve here voluntarily een so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars hector have a great catch if he knock out either of your brains a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel theres ulysses and old nestor whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you like draughtoxen and make you plough up the wars yes good sooth to achilles to ajax to tis no matter i shall speak as much as thou afterwards i will hold my peace when achilles brach bids me shall i i will see you hanged like clotpoles ere i come any more to your tents i will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools how now thersites what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he beats me and i rail at him o worthy satisfaction would it were otherwise that i could beat him whilst he railed at me sfoot ill learn to conjure and raise devils but ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations then theres achilles a rare enginer if troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves o thou great thunderdarter of olympus forget that thou art jove the king of gods and mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which shortarmed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web after this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the boneache for that methinks is the curse dependent on those that war for a placket i have said my prayers and devil envy say amen what ho my lord achilles if i could have remembered a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself the common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee let thy blood be thy direction till thy death then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse ill be sworn and sworn upont she never shrouded any but lazars amen wheres achilles ay the heavens hear me thy commander achilles then tell me patroclus whats achilles thy knower patroclus then tell me patroclus what art thou ill decline the whole question agamemnon commands achilles achilles is my lord i am patroclus knower and patroclus is a fool peace fool i have not done agamemnon is a fool achilles is a fool thersites is a fool and as aforesaid patroclus is a fool agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and patroclus is a fool positive make that demand of the prover it suffices me thou art look you who comes here here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery all the argument is a cuckold and a whore a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all a wonder ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing why he stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say there were wit in this head an twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking the mans undone forever for if hector break not his neck i the combat hell break t himself in vainglory he knows not me i said good morrow ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think you of this man that takes me for the general hes grown a very landfish languageless a monster a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both sides like a leather jerkin who i why hell answer nobody he professes not answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue ins arms i will put on his presence let patroclus make demands to me you shall see the pageant of ajax hum ha hum agamemnon ha god b wi you with all my heart if tomorrow be a fair day by eleven oclock it will go one way or other howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me fare you well with all my heart no but hes out o tune thus what music will be in him when hector has knocked out his brains i know not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo get his sinews to make catlings on let me bear another to his horse for thats the more capable creature would the fountain of your mind were clear again that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance why thou picture of what thou seemest and idol of idiot worshippers heres a letter for thee why thou full dish of fool from troy the surgeons box or the patients wound prithee be silent boy i profit not by thy talk thou art thought to be achilles male varlet why his masculine whore now the rotten diseases of

thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye thou tassel of a prodigals purse thou ah how the poor world is pestered with such waterflies diminutives of nature finchegg with too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad but if with too much brain and too little blood they do ill be a curer of madmen heres agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails but he has not so much brain as earwax and the goodly transformation of jupiter there his brother the bullthe primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds a thrifty shoeinghorn in a chain hanging at his brothers legto what form but that he is should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to to an ass were nothing he is both ass and ox to an ox were nothing he is both ox and ass to be a dog a mule a cat a fitchew a toad a lizard an owl a puttock or a herring without a roe i would not care but to be menelaus i would conspire against destiny ask me not what i would be if i were not thersites

i will no more trust him when he leers than i will a serpent when he hisses he will spend his mouth and promise like brabbler the hound but when he performs astronomers foretell it it is prodigious there will come some change the sun borrows of the moon when diomed keeps his word i will rather leave to see hector than not to dog him they say he keeps a trojan drab and uses the traitor calchas tent ill after nothing but lechery all incontinent varlets and any man may sing her if he can take her cliff shes noted roguery a juggling trickto be secretly open how the devil luxury with his fat rump and potatofinger tickles these together fry lechery fry now the pledge now now now now she sharpens well said whetstone nor i by pluto but that that likes not you pleases me best a proof of

ulysses is not proved worthy a blackberry they set me up in policy that mongrel cur ajax against that dog of as bad a kind achilles and now is the cur ajax prouder than the cur achilles and will not

he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honour but honour for those honours that are without him as place riches favour prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery standers the love that leand on them as slippery too do one pluck down another and together die in the fall but tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these mens looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given here is ulysses ill interrupt his reading how now ulysses what are you reading this is not strange ulysses the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not but commends itself to others eyes nor doth the eye itself that most pure spirit of sense behold itself not going from itself but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each others form for speculation turns not to itself till it hath travelld and is mirrord there where it may see itself this is not strange at all i do believe it for they passd by me

fame is shrewdly gored go call thersites hither sweet patroclus ill send the fool to ajax and desire him to invite the trojan lords after the combat to see us here unarmd i have a womans longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in his weeds of peace to talk with him and to behold his visage even to my full of view   a labour saved what how so how can that be thou must be my ambassador to him thersites to him patroclus tell him i humbly desire the valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarmed to my tent and to procure safeconduct for his person of the

follow me sirs and my proceedings eye it is decreed hector the great must die look hector how the sun begins to set how ugly night comes breathing at his heels even with the vail and darking of the sun to close the day up hectors life is done strike fellows strike this is the man i seek   so ilion fall thou next now troy sink down here lies thy heart thy sinews and thy bone on myrmidons and cry

that knowest you rascal why am i a fool within his tent but ill disposed my lord i shall say so to him achilles bids me say he is much sorry if any thing more than your sport and pleasure did move your greatness and this noble state to call upon him he hopes it is no other but for your health and your digestion sake and afterdinners breath i shall and bring his answer presently they pass by strangely they were used to bend to send their smiles before them to achilles to come as humbly as they used to creep to holy altars to this effect achilles have i moved you a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loathed than an effeminate man in time of action i stand condemnd for this they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold and like a dewdrop from the lions mane be shook to air ay and perhaps receive much honour by him o then beware those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger and danger like an ague subtly taints even then when we sit idly in the sun jove bless great ajax i come from the worthy achilles who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent and to procure safeconduct from agamemnon ay my lord what say you tot your answer sir your answer sir but thats no argument for kissing now for this poppd paris in his hardiment and parted thus you and your argument the first was menelaus kiss this mine patroclus kisses you paris and i kiss evermore for him both take and give here comes thersites who keeps the tent now well said adversity and what need these tricks male varlet you rogue whats that why thou damnable box of envy thou what meanest thou to curse thus why no you ruinous butt you whoreson indistinguishable cur no out gallafter so many hours lives speeches spent thus once again says nestor from the greeks deliver helen and all damage else as honour loss of time travail expense wounds friends and what else dear that is consumed in hot digestion of this cormorant war shall be struck off hector what say you tot what noise what shriek is this paris you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights you have the honey still but these the gall so to be valiant is no praise at all come hector come go back thy wife hath dreamd thy mother hath had visions cassandra doth foresee and i myself am like a prophet suddenly enrapt to tell thee that this day is ominous therefore come back ay but thou shalt not go farewell the gods with safety stand about theethough no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular yet dread priam there is no lady of more softer bowels more spongy to suck in the sense of fear more ready to cry out who knows what follows than hector is the wound of peace is surety surety secure but modest doubt is calld the beacon of the wise the tent that searches to the bottom of the worst let helen go since the first sword was drawn about this question every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours if we have lost so many tenths of ours to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us had it our name the value of one ten what merits in that reason which denies the yielding of her up brother she is not worth what she doth cost the holding but value dwells not in particular will it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein tis precious of itself as in the prizer tis mad idolatry to make the service greater than the god and the will dotes that is attributive to what infectiously itself affects without some image of the affected merit it is cassandra peace sister peace now youthful troilus do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have glozed but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemperd blood than to make up a free determination twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision nature craves all dues be renderd to their owners now what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband if this law of nature be corrupted through affection and that great minds of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills resist the same there is a law in each wellorderd nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to spartas king as it is known she is these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back returnd thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong but makes it much more heavy hectors opinion is this in way of truth yet neertheless my spritely brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for tis a cause that hath no mean dependance upon our joint and several dignities i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamus i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dun and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits i was advertised their great general

thy stay thou on him leaning and all troy on thee fall all together o priam yield not to him o farewell dear hector look how thou diest look how thy eye turns pale look how thy wounds do bleed at many

dead o hector farewell yet soft hector take my leave thou dost thyself and all our troy deceiveelse might the world convince of levity as well my undertakings as your counsels but i attest the gods your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut off all fears attending on so dire a project for what alas can these my single arms what propugnation is in one mans valour to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite yet i protest were i alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as i have will paris should neer retract what he hath done nor faint in the pursuit sir i propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it but i would have the soil of her fair rape wiped off in honourable keeping her what treason were it to the ransackd queen disgrace to your great worths and shame to me now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms theres not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended nor none so noble whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamed where helen is the subject
