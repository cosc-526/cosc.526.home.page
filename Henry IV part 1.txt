so shaken as we are so wan with care find we a time for frighted peace to pant and breathe shortwinded accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood nor more shall trenching war channel her fields nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes which like the meteors of a troubled heaven all of one nature of one substance bred did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance kindred and allies the edge of war like an illsheathed knife no more shall cut his master therefore friends as far as to the sepulchre of christ whose soldier now under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight forthwith a power of english shall we levy whose arms were moulded in their mothers womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walkd those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were naild for our advantage on the bitter cross but this our purpose now is twelve month old and bootless tis to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now then let me hear of you my gentle cousin westmoreland what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land here is a dear a true industrious friend sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse staind with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights balkd in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedons plains of prisoners hotspur took mordake the earl of fife and eldest son to beaten douglas and the earl of athol of murray angus and menteith and is not this an honourable spoil a gallant prize ha cousin is it not but i have sent for him to answer this and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem cousin on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered my blood hath been too cold and temperate unapt to stir at these indignities and you have found me for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself mighty and to be feard than my condition which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul neer pays but to the proud worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you   you were about to speak why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brotherinlaw the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath wilfully betrayd the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damnd glendower whose daughter as we hear the earl of march hath lately married shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home shall we but treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer lords give us leave the prince of wales and i must have some private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you   i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood hell breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only markd for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matchd withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein   how now good blunt thy looks are full of speed the earl of westmoreland set forth today with him my son lord john of lancaster for this advertisement is five days old on wednesday next harry you shall set forward on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting is bridgenorth and harry you shall march through gloucestershire by which account our business valued some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet our hands are full of business lets away advantage feeds him fat while men delay then with the losers let it sympathize for nothing can seem foul to those that win     how now my lord of worcester tis not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet you have deceived our trust and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well my lord this is not well what say you to it will you again unknit this curlish knot of allabhorred war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times you have not sought it how comes it then these things indeed you have articulate proclaimd at marketcrosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such watercolours to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion and prince of wales so dare we venture thee albeit considerations infinite do make against it no good worcester no we love our people well even those we love that are misled upon your cousins part and will they take the offer of our grace both he and they and you every man shall be my friend again and ill be his so tell your cousin and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office so be gone we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair take it advisedly hence therefore every leader to his charge for on their answer will we set on them and god befriend us as our cause is just i will do so my lord of westmoreland lead him to his tent i saw him hold lord percy at the point with lustier maintenance than i did look for of such an ungrown warrior the king himself who douglas grieves at heart so many of his shadows thou hast met and not the very king i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but seeing thou fallst on me so luckily i will assay thee so defend thyself stay and breathe awhile thou hast redeemd thy lost opinion and showd thou makest some tender of my life in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me make up to clifton ill to sir nicholas gawsey thus ever did rebellion find rebuke illspirited worcester did not we send grace pardon and terms of love to all of you and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary misuse the tenor of thy kinsmans trust three knights upon our party slain today a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence bear worcester to the death and vernon too other offenders we will pause upon   how goes the field with all my heart then this remains that we divide our power you son john and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop who as we hear are busily in arms myself and you son harry will towards wales to fight with glendower and the earl of march rebellion in this land shall lose his sway meeting the cheque of such another day and since this business so fair is done let us not leave till all our own be wonmy liege this haste was hot in question and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news whose worst was that the noble mortimer leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower was by the rude hands of that welshman taken a thousand of his people butchered upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse such beastly shameless transformation by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of this matchd with other did my gracious lord for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on holyrood day the gallant hotspur there young harry percy and brave archibald that evervaliant and approved scot at holmedon met where they did spend a sad and bloody hour as by discharge of their artillery and shape of likelihood the news was told for he that brought them in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse uncertain of the issue any way in faith it is a conquest for a prince to boast of this is his uncles teaching this is worcester malevolent to you in all aspects which makes him prune himself and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity i will my liege faith sir johntis more than time that i were there and you too but my powers are there already the king i can tell you looks for us all we must away all night ay but sir john methinks they are exceeding poor and bare too beggarly he is sir john i fear we shall stay too long come my lord ill lead you to your tentyea there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son a son who is the theme of honours tongue amongst a grove the very straightest plant who is sweet fortunes minion and her pride whilst i by looking on the praise of him see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry o that it could be proved that some nighttripping fairy had exchanged in cradleclothes our children where they lay and calld mine percy his plantagenet then would i have his harry and he mine but let him from my thoughts what think you coz of this young percys pride the prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised to his own use he keeps and sends me word i shall have none but mordake earl of fife god pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruind and the soul of every man prophetically doth forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so commonhackneyd in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wonderd at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolingbroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dressd myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from mens hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical neer seen but wonderd at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state mingled his royalty with capering fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffd himself to popularity that being daily swallowd by mens eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sunlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and renderd such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standest thou for thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now now by my sceptre and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession for of no right nor colour like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lions armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what neverdying honour hath he got against renowned douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathling clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas taen him once enlarged him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishops grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell these news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearst and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percys pay to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns to show how much thou art degenerate how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon busky hill the day looks pale at his distemperaturenow hal what time of day is it lad indeed you come

jack what trick hast thou now o glendowerour house my sovereign liege little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly those same noble scots that are your prisoners true who bears hard his brothers death at bristol the lord scroop i speak not this in estimation as what i think might be but what i know is ruminated plotted and set down and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house and yet i must remember you my lord we were the first and dearest of your friends for you my staff of office did i break in richards time and posted day and night to meet you on the way and kiss your hand when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i it was myself my brother and his son that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time you swore to us and you did swear that oath at doncaster that you did nothing purpose gainst the state nor claim no further than your newfalln right the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid but in short space it raind down fortune showering on your head and such a flood of greatness fell on you what with our help what with the absent king what with the injuries of a wanton time the seeming sufferances that you had borne and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly wood to gripe the general sway into your hand forget your oath to us at doncaster and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle hull the cuckoos bird useth the sparrow did oppress our nest grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing but with nimble wing we were enforced for safety sake to fly out of sight and raise this present head whereby we stand opposed by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind usage dangerous countenance and violation of all faith and troth sworn to us in your younger enterprise then are we all undone it is not possible it cannot be the king should keep his word in loving us he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offence in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes for treason is but trusted like the fox who neer so tame so cherishd and lockd up will have a wild trick of his ancestors look how we can or sad or merrily interpretation will misquote our looks and we shall feed like oxen at a stall the better cherishd still the nearer death my nephews trespass may be well forgot it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood and an adopted name of privilege a hairbraind hotspur governd by a spleen all his offences live upon my head and on his fathers we did train him on and his corruption being taen from us we as the spring of all shall pay for all therefore good cousin let not harry know in any case the offer of the kingmy lord yea my good lord those prisoners in your highness name demanded which harry percy here at holmedon took were as he says not with such strength denied as is deliverd to your majesty either envy therefore or misprison is guilty of this fault and not my son what drunk with choler stay and pause awhile here comes your uncle brother the king hath made your nephew mad he was i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king whose wrongs in us god pardondid set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered he did myself did hear it imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience why what a waspstung and impatient fool art thou to break into this womans mood tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own at berkley castle before the game is afoot thou still letst slip farewell good brother we shall thrive i trustmy liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dressd fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reapd showd like a stubbleland at harvesthome he was perfumed like a milliner and twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncetbox which ever and anon he gave his nose and tookt away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talkd and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he calld them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questiond me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majestys behalf i then all smarting with my wounds being cold to be so pesterd with a popinjay out of my grief and my impatience answerd neglectingly i know not what he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waitinggentlewoman of guns and drums and woundsgod save the mark and telling me the sovereignst thing on earth was parmaceti for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villanous saltpetre should be diggd out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyd so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answerd indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty revolted mortimer he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severns sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severns flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank bloodstained with these valiant combatants never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds nor could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly then let not him be slanderd with revolt an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head speak of mortimer zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him yea on his part ill empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the downtrod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and cankerd bolingbroke he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wifes brother then his cheek lookd pale and on my face he turnd an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wished him on the barren mountains starve but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of yougod pardon ithave done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose an plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are foold discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banishd honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdaind contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore i say if he fall in good night or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west so honour cross it from the north to south and let them grapple o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the palefaced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathomline could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities but out upon this halffaced fellowship i cry you mercy ill keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not ill keep them by this hand nay i will thats flat he said he would not ransom mortimer forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear ill holla mortimer nay ill have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same swordandbuckler prince of wales but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance i would have him poisond with a pot of ale why look you i am whippd and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke in richards timewhat do you call the place a plague upon it it is in gloucestershire twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bowd my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh you say true why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me lookwhen his infant fortune came to age and gentle harry percy and kind cousin o the devil take such cozeners god forgive me good uncle tell your tale i have done i have done i faith of york is it not i smell it upon my life it will do well why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha in faith it is exceedingly well aimd he does he does well be revenged

strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinchd and vexd by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and mossgrown towers at your birth our grandam earth having this distemperature in passion shook i think theres no man speaks better welsh ill to dinner why so can i or so can any man

metre balladmongers i had rather hear a brazen canstick turnd or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would set my teeth nothing on edge nothing so much as mincing poetry tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag i do not care ill give thrice so much land to any welldeserving friend but in the way of bargain mark ye me ill cavil on the ninth part of a hair are the indentures drawn shall we be gone i cannot choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a clipwingd griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff as puts me from my faith i tell you what he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils names that were his lackeys i cried hum and well go to but markd him not a word o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summerhouse in christendom well i am schoold good manners be your speed here come our wives and let us take our leave come

be redbreast teacher an the indentures be drawn ill away within these two hours and so come in when ye will well said my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this seasons stamp should go so general current through the world by god i cannot flatter i do defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my hearts love hath no man than yourself nay task me to my word approve me lord do so and tis well   what letters hast thou therei can but thank you letters from him why comes he not himself zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a rustling time who leads his power under whose government come they along sick now droop now this sickness doth infect the very lifeblood of our enterprise tis catching hither even to our camp he writes me here that inward sickness and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possessd of all our purposes what say you to it a perilous gash a very limb loppd off and yet in faith it is not his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom with his help we shall oerturn it topsyturvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole my cousin vernon welcome by my soul no harm what more he shall be welcome too where is his son the nimblefooted madcap prince of wales and his comrades that daffd the world aside and bid it pass no more no more worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim and to the fireeyed maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mailed mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and neer part till one drop down a corse o that glendower were come what may the kings whole battle reach unto forty let it be my father and glendower being both away the powers of us may serve so great a day come let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near die all die merrily well fight with him tonight why say you so looks he not for supply his is certain ours is doubtful tonight say i so are the horses of the enemy in general journeybated and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the worlds regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocency and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performd it too now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him profferd him their oaths gave him their heirs as pages followd him even at the heels in golden multitudes he presently as greatness knows itself steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father while his blood was poor upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh and now forsooth takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth cries out upon abuses seems to weep over his countrys wrongs and by this face this seeming brow of justice did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for proceeded further cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here when he was personal in the irish war then to the point in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that taskd the whole state to make that worse sufferd his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the councilboard in rage dismissd my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which we find too indirect for long continuance not so sir walter well withdraw awhile go to the king and let there be impawnd some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell and may be so we shall my uncle is returnd deliver up my lord of westmoreland uncle what news lord douglas go you and tell him so did you beg any god forbid o would the quarrel lay upon our heads and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth tell me tell me how showd his tasking seemd it in contempt cousin i think thou art enamoured on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a libertine but be he as he will yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldiers arm that he shall shrink under my courtesy arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends better consider what you have to do than i that have not well the gift of tongue can lift your blood up with persuasion i cannot read them now o gentlemen the time of life is short to spend that shortness basely were too long if life did ride upon a dials point still ending at the arrival of an hour an if we live we live to tread on kings if die brave death when princes die with us now for our consciences the arms are fair when the intent of bearing them is just i thank him that he cuts me from my tale for i profess not talking only this let each man do his best and here draw i a sword whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day now esperance percy and set on sound all the lofty instruments of war and by that music let us all embrace for heaven to earth some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy o douglas hadst thou fought at holmedon thus never had triumphd upon a scot where this douglas no i know this face full well a gallant knight he was his name was blunt semblably furnishd like the king himself the king hath many marching in his coats up and away our soldiers stand full fairly for the day if i mistake not thou art harry monmouth my name is harry percy nor shall it harry for the hour is come to end the one of us and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine i can no longer brook thy vanities o harry thou hast robbd me of my youth i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh but thoughts the slave of life and life times fool and time that takes survey of all the world must have a stop o i could prophesy but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue no percy thou art dust and food forthe circumstance considerd good my lord whateer lord harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place at such a time with all the rest retold may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said so he unsay it now so hath the business that i come to speak of lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word that douglas and the english rebels met the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury a mighty and a fearful head they are if promises be kept on every hand as ever offerd foul play in the state and god defend but still i should stand so so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty but to my charge the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot which he confesseth to be manifold he bids you name your griefs and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion i would you would accept of grace and love pray god you do they tell thee true i was not born a yielder thou proud scot and thou shalt find a king that will revenge lord staffords deaththou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy art thou not ashamed but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you my lord northumberland we licence your departure with your son send us your prisoners or you will hear of it i prithee harry withdraw thyself thou bleedst too much lord john of lancaster go you with himwho struck this heat up after i was gone i cannot blame him was not he proclaimd by richard that dead is the next of blood and for whose death we in the worlds wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of peace cousin say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quickconceiving discontents ill read you matter deep and dangerous as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to oerwalk a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend good cousin give me audience for a while you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes those prisoners you shall keep hear you cousin a word nay if you have not to it again we will stay your leisure then once more to your scottish prisoners deliver them up without their ransom straight and make the douglas son your only mean for powers in scotland which for divers reasons which i shall send you written be assured will easily be granted you my lord   your son in scotland being thus employd shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate well beloved the archbishop and so they shall and tis no little reason bids us speed to save our heads by raising of a head for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we think ourselves unsatisfied till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love cousin farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course when time is ripe which will be suddenly ill steal to glendower and lord mortimer where you and douglas and our powers at once as i will fashion it shall happily meet to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms which now we hold at much uncertainty yea but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land and then he runs straight and even i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited his health was never better worth than now your fathers sickness is a maim to us it may not be good cousin be advised stir not tonight hear me my liege for mine own part i could be well content to entertain the lagend of my life with quiet hours for i do protest i have not sought the day of this dislike o no my nephew must not know sir richard the liberal and kind offer of the king there is no seeming mercy in the king i told him gently of our grievances of his oathbreaking which he mended thus by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us the prince of wales steppd forth before the king and nephew challenged you to single fightfarewell kinsman ill talk to you when you are better temperd to attend in faith my lord you are too wilfulblame and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite beside his patience you must needs learn lord to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness courage blood and thats the dearest grace it renders you yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage defect of manners want of government pride haughtiness opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman loseth mens hearts and leaves behind a stain upon the beauty of all parts besides beguiling them of commendation but yet i would your father had been here the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause for well you know we of the offering side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement and stop all sightholes every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your fathers draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound the number of the king exceedeth ours for gods sake cousin stay till all come in the king will bid you battle presently what i have done my safety urged me to and i embrace this fortune patiently since not to be avoided it falls on meheighho an it be not four by the day ill be hanged charles wain is over the new chimney and yet our horse not packed what ostler poor fellow never joyed

learnd the king himself in person is set forth or hitherwards intended speedily with strong and mighty preparation all furnishd all in arms all plumed like estridges that with the wind baited like eagles having lately bathed glittering in golden coats like images as full of spirit as the month of may and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls i saw young harry with his beaver on his cuisses on his thighs gallantly armd rise from the ground like featherd mercury and vaulted with such ease into his seat as if an angel droppd down from the clouds to turn and wind a fiery pegasus and witch the world with noble horsemanship there is more news i learnd in worcester as i rode along he cannot draw his power this fourteen days to thirty thousand not a whit so do we do not my lord do me no slander douglas by my life and i dare well maintain it with my life if wellrespected honour bid me on i hold as little counsel with weak fear as you my lord or any scot that this day lives let it be seen tomorrow in the battle which of us fears content come come it nay not be i wonder much being men of such great leading as you are that you foresee not what impediments drag back our expedition certain horse of my cousin vernons are not yet come up your uncle worcesters horse came but today and now their pride and mettle is asleep their courage with hard labour tame and dull that not a horse is half the half of himself twere best he did deliver what you will ill say tis so here comes your cousin no by my soul i never in my life did hear a challenge urged more modestly unless a brother should a brother dare to gentle exercise and proof of arms he gave you all the duties of a man trimmd up your praises with a princely tongue spoke to your deservings like a chronicle making you ever better than his praise by still dispraising praise valued in you and which became him like a prince indeed he made a blushing cital of himself and chid his truant youth with such a grace as if he masterd there a double spirit of teaching and of learning instantly there did he pause but let me tell the world if he outlive the envy of this day england did never owe so sweet a hope so much misconstrued in his wantonnessyou do not counsel well you speak it out of fear and cold heart yea or tonight the lord of stafford dear today hath bought thy likeness for instead of thee king harry this sword hath ended him so shall it thee unless thou yield thee as my prisoneri come with gracious offers from the king if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect shall i return this answer to the king what is thy name that in the battle thus thou crossest me what honour dost thou seek upon my headtut i came not to hear thishie good sir michael bear this sealed brief with winged haste to the lord marshal this to my cousin scroop and all the rest to whom they are directed if you knew how much they do to import you would make haste like enough you do tomorrow good sir michael is a day wherein the fortune of ten thousand men must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury as i am truly given to understand the king with mighty and quickraised power meets with lord harry and i fear sir michael what with the sickness of northumberland whose power was in the first proportion and what with owen glendowers absence thence who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in oerruled by prophecies i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king and so there is but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales lord john of lancaster the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt and moe corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms i hope no less yet needful tis to fear and to prevent the worst sir michael speed for if lord percy thrive not ere the king dismiss his power he means to visit us for he hath heard of our confederacy and tis but wisdom to make strong against him therefore make haste i must go write again to other friends and so farewell sir michaelmy good lord i guess their tenor why my good lord you need not fear there is douglas and lord mortimer doubt not my lord they shall be well opposedno mortimer is not therebut there is mordake vernon lord harry percy and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors noble gentlemennot i my lord
