open your ears for which of you will stop the vent of hearing when loud rumour speaks i from the orient to the drooping west making the wind my posthorse still unfold the acts commenced on this ball of earth upon my tongues continual slanders ride the which in every language i pronounce stuffing the ears of men with false reports i speak of peace while covert enmity under the smile of safety wounds the world and who but rumour who but only i make fearful musters and prepared defence whiles the big year swoln with some other grief is thought with child by the stern tyrant war and no such matter rumour is a pipe blown by surmises jealousies conjectures and of so easy and so plain a stop that the blunt monster with uncounted heads the stilldiscordant wavering multitude can play upon it but what need i thus my wellknown body to anatomize among my household why is rumour here i run before king harrys victory who in a bloody field by shrewsbury hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops quenching the flame of bold rebellion even with the rebels blood but what mean i to speak so true at first my office is to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell under the wrath of noble hotspurs sword and that the king before the douglas rage stoopd his anointed head as low as death this have i rumourd through the peasant towns between that royal field of shrewsbury and this wormeaten hold of ragged stone where hotspurs father old northumberland lies craftysick the posts come tiring on and not a man of them brings other news than they have learnd of me from rumours

sir o joyful day i would not take a knighthood for my fortunewhat shall i say you are his lordship is walkd forth into the orchard please it your honour knock but at the gate and he himself wilt answertell thou the earl that the lord bardolph doth attend him here noble earl i bring you certain news from shrewsbury i spake with one my lord that came from thence a gentleman well bred and of good name that freely renderd me these news for true who he he was some hilding fellow that had stolen the horse he rode on and upon my life spoke at a venture look here comes more news i cannot think my lord your son is dead sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour we all that are engaged to this loss knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas that if we wrought our life twas ten to one and yet we ventured for the gain proposed choked the respect of likely peril feard and since we are oerset venture again come we will all put forth body and goods the question then lord hastings standeth thus whether our present five and twenty thousand may hold up head without northumberland it was my lord who lined himself with hope eating the air on promise of supply flattering himself in project of a power much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts and so with great imagination proper to madmen led his powers to death and winking leapd into destruction yes if this present quality of war indeed the instant action a cause on foot lives so in hope as in an early spring we see the appearing buds which to prove fruit hope gives not so much warrant as despair that frosts will bite them when we mean to build we first survey the plot then draw the model and when we see the figure of the house then must we rate the cost of the erection which if we find outweighs ability what do we then but draw anew the model in fewer offices or at last desist to build at all much more in this great work which is almost to pluck a kingdom down and set another up should we survey the plot of situation and the model consent upon a sure foundation question surveyors know our own estate how able such a work to undergo to weigh against his opposite or else we fortify in paper and in figures using the names of men instead of men like one that draws the model of a house beyond his power to build it who half through gives oer and leaves his partcreated cost a naked subject to the weeping clouds and waste for churlish winters tyranny what is the king but five and twenty thousand who is it like should lead his forces hitherwhat news lord bardolph every minute now should be the father of some stratagem the times are wild contention like a horse full of high feeding madly hath broke loose and bears down all before him good an god will how is this derived saw you the field came you from shrewsbury here comes my servant travers whom i sent on tuesday last to listen after news now travers what good tidings comes with you ha again said he young harry percys spur was cold of hotspur coldspur that rebellion had met ill luck why should that gentleman that rode by travers give then such instances of loss yea this mans brow like to a titleleaf foretells the nature of a tragic volume so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood hath left a witnessd usurpation say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury how doth my son and brother thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand even such a man so faint so spiritless so dull so dead in look so woebegone drew priams curtain in the dead of night and would have told him half his troy was burnt but priam found the fire ere he his tongue and i my percys death ere thou reportst it this thou wouldst say your son did thus and thus your brother thus so fought the noble douglas stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds but in the end to stop my ear indeed thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise ending with brother son and all are dead why he is dead see what a ready tongue suspicion hath he that but fears the thing he would not know hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes that what he feard is chanced yet speak morton tell thou an earl his divination lies and i will take it as a sweet disgrace and make thee rich for doing me such wrong yet for all this say not that percys dead i see a strange confession in thine eye thou shakest thy head and holdst it fear or sin to speak a truth if he be slain say so the tongue offends not that reports his death and he doth sin that doth belie the dead not he which says the dead is not alive yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell rememberd tolling a departing friend for this i shall have time enough to mourn in poison there is physic and these news having been well that would have made me sick being sick have in some measure made me well and as the wretch whose feverweakend joints like strengthless hinges buckle under life impatient of his fit breaks like a fire out of his keepers arms even so my limbs weakend with grief being now enraged with grief are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel must glove this hand and hence thou sickly quoif thou art a guard too wanton for the head which princes fleshd with conquest aim to hit now bind my brows with iron and approach the raggedst hour that time and spite dare bring to frown upon the enraged northumberland let heaven kiss earth now let not natures hand keep the wild flood confined let order die and let this world no longer be a stage to feed contention in a lingering act but let one spirit of the firstborn cain reign in all bosoms that each heart being set on bloody courses the rude scene may end and darkness be the burier of the dead i knew of this before but to speak truth this present grief had wiped it from my mind go in with me and counsel every man the aptest way for safety and revenge get posts and letters and make friends with speed never so few and never yet more need i pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter give even way unto my rough affairs put not you on the visage of the times and be like them to percy troublesome lady i have given over i will speak no more do what you will your wisdom be your guide alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn and but my going nothing can redeem it beshrew your heart fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me with new lamenting ancient oversights but i must go and meet with danger there or it will seek me in another place and find me worse provided lady o fly to scotland till that the nobles and the armed commons have of their puissance made a little taste come come go in with me tis with my mind as with the tide swelld up unto his height that makes a stillstand running neither way fain would i go to meet the archbishop but many thousand reasons hold me back i will resolve for scotland there am i till time and vantage crave my companymy lord sir john umfrevile turnd me back with joyful tidings and being better horsed outrode me after him came spurring hard a gentleman almost forspent with speed that stoppd by me to breathe his bloodied horse he askd the way to chester and of him i did demand what news from shrewsbury he told me that rebellion had bad luck and that young harry percys spur was cold with that he gave his able horse the head and bending forward struck his armed heels against the panting sides of his poor jade up to the rowelhead and starting so he seemd in running to devour the way staying no longer question this strained passion doth you wrong my lordi ran from shrewsbury my noble lord where hateful death put on his ugliest mask to fright our party douglas is living and your brother yet but for my lord your son you are too great to be by me gainsaid your spirit is too true your fears too certain i am sorry i should force you to believe that which i would to god i had not seen but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state rendering faint quittance wearied and outbreathed to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down the neverdaunted percy to the earth from whence with life he never more sprung up in few his death whose spirit lent a fire even to the dullest peasant in his camp being bruited once took fire and heat away from the best temperd courage in his troops for from his metal was his party steeld which once in him abated all the rest turnd on themselves like dull and heavy lead and as the thing thats heavy in itself upon enforcement flies with greatest speed so did our men heavy in hotspurs loss lend to this weight such lightness with their fear that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim than did our soldiers aiming at their safety fly from the field then was the noble worcester too soon taen prisoner and that furious scot the bloody douglas whose welllabouring sword had three times slain the appearance of the king gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame of those that turnd their backs and in his flight stumbling in fear was took the sum of all is that the king hath won and hath sent out a speedy power to encounter you my lord under the conduct of young lancaster and westmoreland this is the news at full the lives of all your loving complices lean on your health the which if you give oer to stormy passion must perforce decay you cast the event of war my noble lord and summd the account of chance before you said let us make head it was your presurmise that in the dole of blows your son might drop you knew he walkd oer perils on an edge more likely to fall in than to get oer you were advised his flesh was capable of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit would lift him where most trade of danger ranged yet did you say go forth and none of this though strongly apprehended could restrain the stiffborne action what hath then befallen or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth more than that being which was like to be tis more than time and my most noble lord i hear for certain and do speak the truth the gentle archbishop of york is up with wellappointed powers he is a man who with a double surety binds his followers my lord your son had only but the corpse but shadows and the shows of men to fight for that same word rebellion did divide the action of their bodies from their souls and they did fight with queasiness constraind as men drink potions that their weapons only seemd on our side but for their spirits and souls this word rebellion it had froze them up as fish are in a pond but now the bishop turns insurrection to religion supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts hes followed both with body and with mind and doth enlarge his rising with the blood of fair king richard scraped from pomfret stones derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land gasping for life under great bolingbroke and more and less do flock to follow himsirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me the brain of this foolishcompounded clay man is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than i invent or is invented on me i am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men i do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one if the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then i have no judgment thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels i was never manned with an agate till now but i will inset you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is not yet fledged i will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a faceroyal god may finish it when he will tis not a hair amiss yet he may keep it still at a faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it and yet hell be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor he may keep his own grace but hes almost out of mine i can assure him what said master dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and my slops let him be damned like the glutton pray god his tongue be hotter a whoreson achitophel a rascally yeaforsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security the whoreson smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security i had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security i looked a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as i am a true knight and he sends me security well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him wheres bardolph i bought him in pauls and hell buy me a horse in smithfield an i could get me but a wife in the stews i were manned horsed and wived wait close i will not see him lord chiefjusticewhats he that goes there boy tell him i am deaf what a young knave and begging is there not wars is there not employment doth not the king lack subjects do not the rebels need soldiers though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it why sir did i say you were an honest man setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied in my throat if i had said so i give thee leave to tell me so i lay aside that which grows to me if thou gettest

that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible a was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake a came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and swear they were his fancies or his goodnights and now is this vices dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and ill be sworn a neer saw him but once in the tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshals men i saw it and told john a gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eelskin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court and now has he land and beefs well ill be acquainted with him if i return and it shall go hard but i will make him a philosophers two stones to me if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him let time shape and there an end whats your name sir of what condition are you and of what place i pray well then colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale colevile shall be still your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still colevile of the dale as good a man as he sir whoeer i am do ye yield sir or shall i sweat for you if i do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy i have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name an i had but a belly of any indifference i were simply the most active fellow in europe my womb my womb my womb undoes me here comes our general i would be sorry my lord but it should be thus i never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward of valour do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet have i in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought i have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility i have foundered nine score and odd posts and here traveltainted as i am have in my pure and immaculate valour taken sir john colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy but what of that he saw me and yielded that i may justly say with the hooknosed fellow of rome i came saw and overcame i know not here he is and here i yield him and i beseech your grace let it be booked with the rest of this days deeds or by the lord i will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top ont colevile kissing my foot to the which course if i be enforced if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the clear sky of fame oershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins heads to her believe not the word of the noble therefore let me have right and let desert mount let it shine then let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will and a famous true subject took him i know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i thank thee for thee my lord i beseech you give me leave to go through gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good report i would you had but the wit twere better than your dukedom good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but thats no marvel he drinks no wine theres never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and making many fishmeals that they fall into a kind of male greensickness and then when they marry they get wenches they are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation a good sherris sack hath a twofold operation in it it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered oer to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it awork and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant if i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack   how now bardolph let them go ill through gloucestershire and there will i visit master robert shallow esquire i have him already tempering between my finger and my thumb and shortly will i seal with him come away you must excuse me master robert shallow ill follow you good master robert shallow   bardolph look to our horses   if i were sawed into quantities i should make four dozen of such bearded hermits staves as master shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his mens spirits and his they by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justicelike servingman their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wildgeese if i had a suit to master shallow i would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men i would curry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company i will devise matter enough out of this shallow to keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and a shall laugh without intervallums o it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders o you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up i come master shallow i come master shallow fore god you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich this davy serves you for good uses he is your servingman and your husband theres a merry heart good master silence ill give you a health for that anon i did not think master silence had been a

now going with some charge to the lord john of lancaster lord chiefjusticewhat to york call him back again sir john falstaff sir john you mistake me sir i pray you sir then set your knighthood and our soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say i am any other than an honest man sir my lord would speak with you lord chiefjusticesir john falstaff a word with youthus have you heard our cause and known our means and my most noble friends i pray you all speak plainly your opinions of our hopes and first lord marshal what say you to it tis very true lord bardolph for indeed it was young hotspurs case at shrewsbury what is this forest calld here stand my lords and send discoverers forth to know the numbers of our enemies tis well done my friends and brethren in these great affairs i must acquaint you that i have received newdated letters from northumberland their cold intent tenor and substance thus here doth he wish his person with such powers as might hold sortance with his quality the which he could not levy whereupon he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers that your attempts may overlive the hazard and fearful melting of their opposite what wellappointed leader fronts us here say on my lord of westmoreland in peace what doth concern your coming wherefore do i this so the question stands briefly to this end we are all diseased and with our surfeiting and wanton hours have brought ourselves into a burning fever and we must bleed for it of which disease our late king richard being infected died but my most noble lord of westmoreland i take not on me here as a physician nor do i as an enemy to peace troop in the throngs of military men but rather show awhile like fearful war to diet rank minds sick of happiness and purge the obstructions which begin to stop our very veins of life hear me more plainly i have in equal balance justly weighd what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer and find our griefs heavier than our offences we see which way the stream of time doth run and are enforced from our most quiet there by the rough torrent of occasion and have the summary of all our griefs when time shall serve to show in articles which long ere this we offerd to the king and might by no suit gain our audience when we are wrongd and would unfold our griefs we are denied access unto his person even by those men that most have done us wrong the dangers of the days but newly gone whose memory is written on the earth with yet appearing blood and the examples of every minutes instance present now hath put us in these illbeseeming arms not to break peace or any branch of it but to establish here a peace indeed concurring both in name and quality then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule for this contains our general grievances each several article herein redressd all members of our cause both here and hence that are insinewd to this action acquitted by a true substantial form and present execution of our wills to us and to our purposes confined we come within our awful banks again and knit our powers to the arm of peace my lord we will do so no no my lord note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no telltale to his memory that may repeat and history his loss to new remembrance for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolved correction in the arm that was upreard to execution before and greet his grace my lord we come i take your princely word for these redresses i do not doubt you against ill chances men are ever merry but heaviness foreruns the good event believe me i am passing light in spirit a peace is of the nature of a conquest for then both parties nobly are subdued and neither party loser go good lord hastings and ere they be dismissed let them march byi well allow the occasion of our arms but gladly would be better satisfied how in our means we should advance ourselves to look with forehead bold and big enough upon the power and puissance of the king shall we go draw our numbers and set on thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground and dash themselves to pieces the just proportion that we gave them out let us sway on and face them in the field i think it is my lord of westmoreland why not to him in part and to us all that feel the bruises of the days before and suffer the condition of these times to lay a heavy and unequal hand upon our honours what thing in honour had my father lost that need to be revived and breathed in me the king that loved him as the state stood then was force perforce compelld to banish him and then that harry bolingbroke and he being mounted and both roused in their seats their neighing coursers daring of the spur their armed staves in charge their beavers down their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel and the loud trumpet blowing them together then then when there was nothing could have stayd my father from the breast of bolingbroke o when the king did throw his warder down his own life hung upon the staff he threw then threw he down himself and all their lives that by indictment and by dint of sword have since miscarried under bolingbroke but he hath forced us to compel this offer and it proceeds from policy not love well by my will we shall admit no parley there is a thing within my bosom tells me that no conditions of our peace can stand yea but our valuation shall be such that every slight and falsederived cause yea every idle nice and wanton reason shall to the king taste of this action that were our royal faiths martyrs in love we shall be winnowd with so rough a wind that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff and good from bad find no partition be it so here is returnd my lord of westmoreland your grace of york in gods name then set forward if not we ready are to try our fortunes to the last man you wish me health in very happy season for i am on the sudden something ill so much the worse if your own rule be true this had been cheerful after victory is this proceeding just and honourableour present musters grow upon the file to five and twenty thousand men of choice and our supplies live largely in the hope of great northumberland whose bosom burns with an incensed fire of injuries with him we may but by your leave it never yet did hurt to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth should be stillborn and that we now possessd the utmost man of expectation i think we are a body strong enough even as we are to equal with the king to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph for his divisions as the times do brawl are in three heads one power against the french and one against glendower perforce a third must take up us so is the unfirm king in three divided and his coffers sound with hollow poverty and emptiness if he should do so he leaves his back unarmd the french and welsh baying him at the heels never fear that the duke of lancaster and westmoreland against the welsh himself and harry monmouth but who is substituted gainst the french i have no certain notice we are times subjects and time bids be gone tis gaultree forest ant shall please your grace we have sent forth already now what news hath the prince john a full commission in very ample virtue of his father to hear and absolutely to determine of what conditions we shall stand upon fear you not that if we can make our peace upon such large terms and so absolute as our conditions shall consist upon our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains besides the king hath wasted all his rods on late offenders that he now doth lack the very instruments of chastisement so that his power like to a fangless lion may offer but not hold and though we here fall down we have supplies to second our attempt if they miscarry theirs shall second them and so success of mischief shall be born and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up whiles england shall have generation go captain and deliver to the army this news of peace let them have pay and part i know it will well please them hie thee captain my lord our army is dispersed already like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses east west north south or like a school broke up each hurries toward his home and sportingplacethat he should draw his several strengths together and come against us in full puissance need not be dreaded will you thus break your faithlet us on and publish the occasion of our arms the commonwealth is sick of their own choice their overgreedy love hath surfeited an habitation giddy and unsure hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart o thou fond many with what loud applause didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke before he was what thou wouldst have him be and being now trimmd in thine own desires thou beastly feeder art so full of him that thou provokest thyself to cast him up so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge thy glutton bosom of the royal richard and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up and howlst to find it what trust is in these times they that when richard lived would have him die are now become enamourd on his grave thou that threwst dust upon his goodly head when through proud london he came sighing on after the admired heels of bolingbroke criest now o earth yield us that king again and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed past and to come seems best things present worst my brother general the commonwealth to brother born an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular tis very true and therefore be assured my good lord marshal if we do now make our atonement well our peace will like a broken limb united grow stronger for the breaking good my lord of lancaster i am not here against your fathers peace but as i told my lord of westmoreland the time misorderd doth in common sense crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form to hold our safety up i sent your grace the parcels and particulars of our grief the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court whereon this hydra son of war is born whose dangerous eyes may well be charmd asleep with grant of our most just and right desires and true obedience of this madness cured stoop tamely to the foot of majesty to you my noble lord of

exceeding weary faith it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer belike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth i do now remember the poor creature small beer but indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness what a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy peachcoloured ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and another for use but that the tenniscourtkeeper knows better than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland and god knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened shall i tell thee one thing poins it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine marry i tell thee it is not meet that i should be sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend i could be sad and sad indeed too by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devils book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end try the man but i tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep it would be every mans thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never a mans thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine every man would think me an hypocrite indeed and what accites your most worshipful thought to think so has not the boy profited instruct us boy what dream boy a crowns worth of good interpretation there tis boy and how doth thy master bardolph i do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds his place for look you how be writes nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from japhet but to the letter peace thats to make him eat twenty of his words but do you use me thus ned must i marry your sister well thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us is your master here in london what company sup any women with him what pagan may that be even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull shall we steal upon them ned at supper sirrah you boy and bardolph no word to your master that i am yet come to town theres for your silence fare you well go   this doll tearsheet should be some road from a god to a bull a heavy decension it was joves case from a prince to a prentice a low transformation that shall be mine for in every thing the purpose must weigh with the folly follow me ned would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off look whether the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot very true sir and i come to draw you out by the ears you whoreson candlemine you how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest virtuous civil gentlewoman i shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse and then i know how to handle you not to dispraise me and call me pantier and breadchipper and i know not what see now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us is she of the wicked is thine hostess here of the wicked or is thy boy of the wicked or honest bardolph whose zeal burns in his nose of the wicked for the women peto how now what news by heaven poins i feel me much to blame so idly to profane the precious time when tempest of commotion like the south borne with black vapour doth begin to melt and drop upon our bare unarmed heads give me my sword and cloak falstaff good night how now rain within doors and none abroad how doth the king if he be sick with joy hell recover without physic no i will sit and watch here by the king   why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow being so troublesome a bedfellow o polishd perturbation golden care that keepst the ports of slumber open wide to many a watchful night sleep with it now yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet as he whose brow with homely biggen bound snores out the watch of night o majesty when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit like a rich armour worn in heat of day that scalds with safety by his gates of breath there lies a downy feather which stirs not did he suspire that light and weightless down perforce must move my gracious lord my father this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep that from this golden rigol hath divorced so many english kings thy due from me is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood which nature love and filial tenderness shall o dear father pay thee plenteously my due from thee is this imperial crown which as immediate as thy place and blood derives itself to me lo here it sits which god shall guard and put the worlds whole strength into one giant arm it shall not force this lineal honour from me this from thee will i to mine leave as tis left to me i never thought to hear you speak again o pardon me my liege but for my tears the moist impediments unto my speech i had forestalld this dear and deep rebuke ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard the course of it so far there is your crown and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours if i affect it more than as your honour and as your renown let me no more from this obedience rise which my most inward true and duteous spirit teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending god witness with me when i here came in and found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart if i do feign o let me in my present wildness die and never live to show the incredulous world the noble change that i have purposed coming to look on you thinking you dead and dead almost my liege to think you were i spake unto this crown as having sense and thus upbraided it the care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold other less fine in carat is more precious preserving life in medicine potable but thou most fine most honourd most renownd hast eat thy bearer up thus my most royal liege accusing it i put it on my head to try with it as with an enemy that had before my face murderd my father the quarrel of a true inheritor but if it did infect my blood with joy or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride if any rebel or vain spirit of mine did with the least affection of a welcome give entertainment to the might of it let god for ever keep it from my head and make me as the poorest vassal is that doth with awe and terror kneel to it my gracious liege you won it wore it kept it gave it me then plain and right must my possession be which i with more than with a common pain gainst all the world will rightfully maintainist come to that i had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly

upon him as the sun in the grey vault of heaven and by his light did all the chivalry of england move to do brave acts he was indeed the glass wherein the noble youth did dress themselves he had no legs that practised not his gait and speaking thick which nature made his blemish became the accents of the valiant for those that could speak low and tardily would turn their own perfection to abuse to seem like him so that in speech in gait in diet in affections of delight in military rules humours of blood he was the mark and glass copy and book that fashiond others and him o wondrous him o miracle of men him did you leave second to none unseconded by you to look upon the hideous god of war in disadvantage to abide a field where nothing but the sound of hotspurs name did seem defensible

westminster and there are twenty weak and wearied posts come from the north and as i came along i met and overtook a dozen captains bareheaded sweating knocking at the taverns and asking every one for sir john falstaffgo call the earls of surrey and of warwick but ere they come bid them oerread these letters and well consider of them make good speed   how many thousand of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep o sleep o gentle sleep natures soft nurse how have i frighted thee that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching thee and hushd with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber than in the perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulld with sound of sweetest melody o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch a watchcase or a common larumbell wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the shipboys eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude imperious surge and in the visitation of the winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with deafening clamour in the slippery clouds that with the hurly death itself awakes canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose to the wet seaboy in an hour so rude and in the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means to boot deny it to a king then happy low lie down uneasy lies the head that wears a crown is it good morrow lords why then good morrow to you all my lords have you read oer the letters that i sent you o god that one might read the book of fate and see the revolution of the times make mountains level and the continent weary of solid firmness melt itself into the sea and other times to see the beachy girdle of the ocean too wide for neptunes hips how chances mock and changes fill the cup of alteration with divers liquors o if this were seen the happiest youth viewing his progress through what perils past what crosses to ensue would shut the book and sit him down and die tis not ten years gone since richard and northumberland great friends did feast together and in two years after were they at wars it is but eight years since this percy was the man nearest my soul who like a brother toild in my affairs and laid his love and life under my foot yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard gave him defiance but which of you was by you cousin nevil as i may remember   when richard with his eye brimful of tears then chequed and rated by northumberland did speak these words now proved a prophecy northumberland thou ladder by the which my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne though then god knows i had no such intent but that necessity so bowd the state that i and greatness were compelld to kiss the time shall come thus did he follow it the time will come that foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption so went on foretelling this same times condition and the division of our amity are these things then necessities then let us meet them like necessities and that same word even now cries out on us they say the bishop and northumberland are fifty thousand strong now lords if god doth give successful end to this debate that bleedeth at our doors we will our youth lead on to higher fields and draw no swords but what are sanctified our navy is addressd our power collected our substitutes in absence well invested and every thing lies level to our wish only we want a little personal strength and pause us till these rebels now afoot come underneath the yoke of government and how accompanied is not his brother thomas of clarence with him nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas thou hast a better place in his affection than all thy brothers cherish it my boy and noble offices thou mayst effect of mediation after i am dead between his greatness and thy other brethren therefore omit him not blunt not his love nor lose the good advantage of his grace by seeming cold or careless of his will for he is gracious if he be observed he hath a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity yet notwithstanding being incensed hes flint as humorous as winter and as sudden as flaws congealed in the spring of day his temper therefore must be well observed chide him for faults and do it reverently when thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth but being moody give him line and scope till that his passions like a whale on ground confound themselves with working learn this thomas and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in that the united vessel of their blood mingled with venom of suggestion as force perforce the age will pour it in shall never leak though it do work as strong as aconitum or rash gunpowder why art thou not at windsor with him thomas and how accompanied canst thou tell that most subject is the fattest soil to weeds and he the noble image of my youth is overspread with them therefore my grief stretches itself beyond the hour of death the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape in forms imaginary the unguided days and rotten times that you shall look upon when i am sleeping with my ancestors for when his headstrong riot hath no curb when rage and hot blood are his counsellors when means and lavish manners meet together o with what wings shall his affections fly towards fronting peril and opposed decay tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb in the dead carrion   whos here westmoreland o westmoreland thou art a summer bird which ever in the haunch of winter sings the lifting up of day   look heres more news and wherefore should these good news make me sick will fortune never come with both hands full but write her fair words still in foulest letters she either gives a stomach and no food such are the poor in health or else a feast and takes away the stomach such are the rich that have abundance and enjoy it not i should rejoice now at this happy news and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy o me come near me now i am much ill i pray you take me up and bear me hence into some other chamber softly pray set me the crown upon my pillow here warwick gloucester clarence why did you leave me here alone my lords the prince of wales where is he let me see him he is not here where is the crown who took it from my pillow the prince hath taen it hence go seek him out is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death find him my lord of warwick chide him hither   this part of his conjoins with my disease and helps to end me see sons what things you are how quickly nature falls into revolt when gold becomes her object for this the foolish overcareful fathers have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care their bones with industry for this they have engrossed and piled up the cankerd heaps of strangeachieved gold for this they have been thoughtful to invest their sons with arts and martial exercises when like the bee culling from every flower the virtuous sweets our thighs packd with wax our mouths with honey we bring it to the hive and like the bees are murdered for our pains this bitter taste yield his engrossments to the ending father   now where is he that will not stay so long till his friend sickness hath determined me but wherefore did he take away the crown   lo where he comes come hither to me harry depart the chamber leave us here alone thy wish was father harry to that thought i stay too long by thee i weary thee dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours before thy hour be ripe o foolish youth thou seekst the greatness that will oerwhelm thee stay but a little for my cloud of dignity is held from falling with so weak a wind that it will quickly drop my day is dim thou hast stolen that which after some few hours were thine without offence and at my death thou hast seald up my expectation thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not and thou wilt have me die assured of it thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart to stab at half an hour of my life what canst thou not forbear me half an hour then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear that thou art crowned not that i am dead let all the tears that should bedew my hearse be drops of balm to sanctify thy head only compound me with forgotten dust give that which gave thee life unto the worms pluck down my officers break my decrees for now a time is come to mock at form harry the fifth is crownd up vanity down royal state all you sage counsellors hence and to the english court assemble now from every region apes of idleness now neighbour confines purge you of your scum have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance revel the night rob murder and commit the oldest sins the newest kind of ways be happy he will trouble you no more england shall double gild his treble guilt england shall give him office honour might for the fifth harry from curbd licence plucks the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog shall flesh his tooth on every innocent o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows when that my care could not withhold thy riots what wilt thou do when riot is thy care o thou wilt be a wilderness again peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants o my son god put it in thy mind to take it hence that thou mightst win the more thy fathers love pleading so wisely in excuse of it come hither harry sit thou by my bed and hear i think the very latest counsel that ever i shall breathe god knows my son by what bypaths and indirect crookd ways i met this crown and i myself know well how troublesome it sat upon my head to thee it shall descend with bitter quiet better opinion better confirmation for all the soil of the achievement goes with me into the earth it seemd in me but as an honour snatchd with boisterous hand and i had many living to upbraid my gain of it by their assistances which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed wounding supposed peace all these bold fears thou seest with peril i have answered for all my reign hath been but as a scene acting that argument and now my death changes the mode for what in me was purchased falls upon thee in a more fairer sort so thou the garland wearst successively yet though thou standst more sure than i could do thou art not firm enough since griefs are green and all my friends which thou must make thy friends have but their stings and teeth newly taen out by whose fell working i was first advanced and by whose power i well might lodge a fear to be again displaced which to avoid i cut them off and had a purpose now to lead out many to the holy land lest rest and lying still might make them look too near unto my state therefore my harry be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out may waste the memory of the former days more would i but my lungs are wasted so that strength of speech is utterly denied me how i came by the crown o god forgive and grant it may with thee in true peace live look look here comes my john of lancaster thou bringst me happiness and peace son john but health alack with youthful wings is flown from this bare witherd trunk upon thy sight my worldly business makes a period where is my lord of warwick laud be to god even there my life must end it hath been prophesied to me many years i should not die but in jerusalem which vainly i supposed the holy land but bear me to that chamber there ill lie in that jerusalem shall harry die my lord chiefjustice speak to that vain man lord chiefjusticehave you your wits know you what tis to speak i know thee not old man fall to thy prayers how ill white hairs become a fool and jester i have long dreamd of such a kind of man so surfeitswelld so old and so

foolborn jest presume not that i am the thing i was for god doth know so shall the world perceive that i have turnd away my former self so will i those that kept me company when thou dost hear i am as i have been approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast the tutor and the feeder of my riots till then i banish thee on pain of death as i have done the rest of my misleaders not to come near our person by ten mile for competence of life i will allow you that lack of means enforce you not to evil and as we hear you do reform yourselves we will according to your strengths and qualities give you advancement be it your charge my lord to see performd the tenor of our word set onmany good morrows to your majesty tis one oclock and past we have my liege it is but as a body yet distemperd which to his former strength may be restored with good advice and little medicine my lord northumberland will soon be coold there is a history in all mens lives figuring the nature of the times deceased the which observed a man may prophesy with a near aim of the main chance of things as yet not come to life which in their seeds and weak beginnings lie intreasured such things become the hatch and brood of time and by the necessary form of this king richard might create a perfect guess that great northumberland then false to him would of that seed grow to a greater falseness which should not find a ground to root upon unless on you it cannot be my lord rumour doth double like the voice and echo the numbers of the feard please it your grace to go to bed upon my soul my lord the powers that you already have sent forth shall bring this prize in very easily to comfort you the more i have received a certain instance that glendower is dead your majesty hath been this fortnight ill and these unseasond hours perforce must add unto your sickness both which we doubt not but your majesty shall soon enjoy my gracious lord you look beyond him quite the prince but studies his companions like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language tis needful that the most immodest word be lookd upon and learnd which once attaind your highness knows comes to no further use but to be known and hated so like gross terms the prince will in the perfectness of time cast off his followers and their memory shall as a pattern or a measure live by which his grace must mete the lives of others turning past evils to advantages be patient princes you do know these fits are with his highness very ordinary stand from him give him air hell straight be well speak lower princes for the king recovers call for

dead harry o that the living harry had the temper of him the worst of these three gentlemen how many nobles then should hold their places that must strike sail to spirits of vile sort lord

that rebellion came like itself in base and abject routs led on by bloody youth guarded with rags and countenanced by boys and beggary i say if damnd commotion so appeard in his true native and most proper shape you reverend father and these noble lords had not been here to dress the ugly form of base and bloody insurrection with your fair honours you lord archbishop whose see is by a civil peace maintained whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touchd whose learning and good letters peace hath tutord whose white investments figure innocence the dove and very blessed spirit of peace wherefore do you so ill translate ourself out of the speech of peace that bears such grace into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war turning your books to graves your ink to blood your pens to lances and your tongue divine to a trumpet and a point of war when ever yet was your appeal denied wherein have you been galled by the king what peer hath been subornd to grate on you that you should seal this lawless bloody book of forged rebellion with a seal divine and consecrate commotions bitter edge there is no need of any such redress or if there were it not belongs to you o my good lord mowbray construe the times to their necessities and you shall say indeed it is the time and not the king that doth you injuries yet for your part it not appears to me either from the king or in the present time that you should have an inch of any ground to build a grief on were you not restored to all the duke of norfolks signories your noble and right well rememberd fathers you speak lord mowbray now you know not what the earl of hereford was reputed then in england the most valiant gentlemen who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled but if your father had been victor there he neer had borne it out of coventry for all the country in a general voice cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love were set on hereford whom they doted on and blessd and graced indeed more than the king but this is mere digression from my purpose here come i from our princely general to know your griefs to tell you from his grace that he will give you audience and wherein it shall appear that your demands are just you shall enjoy them every thing set off that might so much as think you enemies mowbray you overween to take it so this offer comes from mercy not from fear for lo within a ken our army lies upon mine honour all too confident to give admittance to a thought of fear our battle is more full of names than yours our men more perfect in the use of arms our armour all as strong our cause the best then reason will our heart should be as good say you not then our offer is compelld that argues but the shame of your offence a rotten case abides no handling that is intended in the generals name i muse you make so slight a question this will i show the general please you lords in sight of both our battles we may meet and either end in peace which god so frame or to the place of difference call the swords which must decide it the prince is here at hand pleaseth your lordship to meet his grace just distance tween our armies pleaseth your grace to answer them

day to you gentle lord archbishop and so to you lord hastings and to all my lord of york it better showd with you when that your flock assembled by the bell encircled you to hear with reverence your exposition on the holy text than now to see you here an iron man cheering a rout of rebels with your drum turning the word to sword and life to death that man that sits within a monarchs heart and ripens in the sunshine of his favour would he abuse the countenance of the king alack what mischiefs might he set abrooch in shadow of such greatness with you lord bishop it is even so who hath not heard it spoken how deep you were within the books of god to us the speaker in his parliament to us the imagined voice of god himself the very opener and intelligencer between the grace the sanctities of heaven and our dull workings o who shall believe but you misuse the reverence of your place employ the countenance and grace of heaven as a false favourite doth his princes name in deeds dishonourable you have taen up under the counterfeited zeal of god the subjects of his substitute my father and both against the peace of heaven and him have here upswarmd them you are too shallow hastings much too shallow to sound the bottom of the aftertimes i like them all and do allow them well and swear here by the honour of my blood my fathers purposes have been mistook and some about him have too lavishly wrested his meaning and authority my lord these griefs shall be with speed redressd upon my soul they shall if this may please you discharge your powers unto their several counties

most you are i think assured i love you not lord chiefjusticei am assured if i be measured rightly your majesty hath no just cause to hate me no how might a prince of my great hopes forget so great indignities you laid upon me what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison the immediate heir of england was this easy may this be washd in lethe and forgotten lord chiefjusticei then did use the person of your father the image of his power lay then in me and in the administration of his law whiles i was busy for the commonwealth your highness pleased to forget my place the majesty and power of law and justice the image of the king whom i presented and struck me in my very seat of judgment whereon as an offender to your father i gave bold way to my authority and did commit you if the deed were ill be you contented wearing now the garland to have a son set your decrees at nought to pluck down justice from your awful bench to trip the course of law and blunt the sword that guards the peace and safety of your person nay more to spurn at your most royal image and mock your workings in a second body question your royal thoughts make the case yours be now the father and propose a son hear your own dignity so much profaned see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted behold yourself so by a son disdaind and then imagine me taking your part and in your power soft silencing your son after this cold considerance sentence me and as you are a king speak in your state what i have done that misbecame my place my person or my lieges sovereignty you are right justice and you weigh this well therefore still bear the balance and the sword and i do wish your honours may increase till you do live to see a son of mine offend you and obey you as i did so shall i live to speak my fathers words happy am i that have a man so bold that dares do justice on my proper son and not less happy having such a son that would deliver up his greatness so into the hands of justice you did commit me for which i do commit into your hand the unstained sword that you have used to bear with this remembrance that you use the same with the like bold just and impartial spirit as you have done gainst me there is my hand you shall be as a father to my youth my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear and i will stoop and humble my intents to your wellpractised wise directions and princes all believe me i beseech you my father is gone wild into his grave for in his tomb lie my affections and with his spirit sadly i survive to mock the expectation of the world to frustrate prophecies and to raze out rotten opinion who hath writ me down after my seeming the tide of blood in me hath proudly flowd in vanity till now now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea where it shall mingle with the state of floods and flow henceforth in formal majesty now call we our high court of parliament and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel that the great body of our state may go in equal rank with the best governd nation that war or peace or both at once may be as things acquainted and familiar to us in which you father shall have foremost hand our coronation done we will accite as i before
