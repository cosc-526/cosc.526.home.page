changes his age is the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of longengraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them there is further compliment of leavetaking between france and him pray you lets hit together if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender

carp and quarrel breaking forth in rank and nottobe endured riots sir i had thought by making this well known unto you to have found a safe redress but now grow fearful by what yourself too late have spoke and done that you protect this course and put it on by your allowance which if you should the fault would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep which in the tender of a wholesome weal might in their working do you that offence which else were shame that then necessity will call discreet proceeding come sir i would you would make use of that good wisdom whereof i know you are fraught and put away these dispositions that of late transform you from what you rightly are this admiration sir is much o the savour of other your new pranks i do beseech you to understand my purposes aright as you are old and reverend you should be wise here do you keep a hundred knights and squires men so disorderd so deboshd and bold that this our court infected with their manners shows like a riotous inn epicurism and lust make it more like a tavern or a brothel than a graced palace the shame itself doth speak for instant remedy be then desired by her that else will take the thing she begs a little to disquantity your train and the remainder that shall still depend to be such men as may besort your age and know themselves and you you strike my people and your disorderd rabble make servants of their betters never afflict yourself to know the cause but let his disposition have that scope that dotage gives it do you mark that my lord pray you content what oswald ho   you sir more knave than fool
