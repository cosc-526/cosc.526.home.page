before we proceed any further hear me speak you are all resolved rather to die than to famish we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge very well and could be content to give him good report fort but that he pays himself with being proud i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though softconscienced men

pray you why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours will you undo yourselves i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale t a little more there was a time when all the bodys members rebelld against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i the midst o the body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where the other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answerd sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which neer came from the lungs but even thus for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speakit tauntingly replied to the discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you what then fore me this fellow speaks what then what then well what then i will tell you if youll bestow a smallof what you have little patience awhile youll hear the bellys answer note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answerd true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friendsthis says the belly mark me though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran what say you tot the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o the common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly for that being one o the lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou gost foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run leadst first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale   hail noble marcius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop what is granted them this is strange o truebred the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight not according to the prayer of the people for they love not marcius pray you who does the wolf love ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o the righthand file do you because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cant say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you     how now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow your eyes so fast ha marcius coming home take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo marcius coming home i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years health in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horsedrench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded so do i too if it be not too much brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become him has he disciplined aufidius soundly and twas time for him too ill warrant him that an he had stayed by him i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold thats in them is the senate possessed of this wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing true ill be sworn they are true where is he wounded   god save your good worships marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded one i the neck and two i the thightheres nine that i know now its twentyseven every gash was an enemys grave   hark the trumpets now the gods crown thee a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root ons heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crabtrees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our aftermeeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our wellfound successes to report a little of that worthy work performd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself thats off thats off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow worthy cominius speak   nay keep your place pray now sit down masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius worthy man hes right noble let him be calld for the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul it then remains that you do speak to the people put them not tot pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form do not stand upont we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have donet o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you youll mar all ill leave you pray you speak to em i pray you in wholesome manner you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the peoples voice remains that in the official marks invested you anon do meet the senate ill keep you company will you along the matter be calm be calm lets be calm not now not now well no more what what his choler well well no more of that come enough on both sides more respect what is about to be i am out of breath confusions near i cannot speak you tribunes to the people coriolanus patience speak good sicinius fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench and so are like to do hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word to brutus  be that you seem truly your countrys friend and temperately proceed to what you would thus violently redress down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile go get you to your house be gone away all will be naught else sham it be put to that for tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you be gone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another pray you be gone ill try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patchd with cloth of any colour his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove fors power to thunder his hearts his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death   heres goodly work i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak em fair you worthy tribunes sir sir do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant hear me speak as i do know the consuls worthiness so can i name his faults the consul coriolanus if by the tribunes leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enrolld in joves own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own o hes a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome thats worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ouncehe droppd it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that dot and suffer it a brand to the end o the world the service of the foot being once gangrened is not then respected for what before it was one word more one word this tigerfooted rage when it shall find the harm of unscannd swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds tos heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans consider this he has been bred i the wars since he could draw a sword and is ill schoold in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave ill go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril ill bring him to you   let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to the herd but that the violent fit o the time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear return to the tribunes repent what you have spoke a good demand noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being askd as free as words to little purpose only fair speech ay but mildly calmly i do beseech you a noble wish lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i the holy churchyard consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you nay temperately your promise is this the promise that you made your mother thats worthily as any ear can hear come lets not weep if i could shake off but one seven years from these old arms and legs by the good gods ild with thee every foot peace peace be not so loud come come peace you have told them home and by my troth you have cause youll sup with me fie fie fie hail to you both alls well and might have been much better if he could have temporized nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him i think not so tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like have been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety what news what news whats the news whats the news pray now your news you have made fair work i fear mepray your news if marcius should be joind with volscians you have made good work you and your apronmen you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of garliceaters as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair how was it we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o the city here come the clusters and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus exile now hes coming and not a hair upon a soldiers head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it you have made good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol no ill not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he calld me father but what o that go you that banishd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyd to hear cominius speak ill keep at home do you hear why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have rackd for rome to make coals cheapa noble memory very well could he say less for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you no ill not meddle what should i do well and say that marcius return me as cominius is returnd unheard what then but as a discontented friend griefshot with his unkindness sayt be so ill undertake t i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffd these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore ill watch him till he be dieted to my request and then ill set upon him good faith ill prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success you guard like men tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus from rome good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touchd your ears it is menenius i tell thee fellow the general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his name unparalleld haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom hes chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stampd the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general has he dined canst thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner i am as thy general is sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation i mean thy general nay but fellow fellow now you companion ill say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus guess but by my entertainment with him if thou standest not i the state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee   the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does o my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet herethis who like a block hath denied my access to thee how away i neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think theres any yere so slight he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age i say to you as i was said to away see you yond coign o the capitol yond cornerstone if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him but i say there is no hope int our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings hes more than a creeping thing so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eightyearold horse the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us when we banished him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us this is good news i will go meet the ladies this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full you have prayd well today this morning for ten thousand of your throats id not have given a doit hark how they joythanks whats the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland whats the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another whats their seeking hang em they say theyll sit by the fire and presume to know whats done i the capitol whos like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say theres grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword ill make a quarry with thousands of these quarterd slaves as high as i could pick my lance they are dissolved hang em they said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answerd and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look palethey threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o the moon shouting their emulation five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice ones junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know notsdeath the rabble should have first unroofd the city ere so prevaild with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrections arguing go get you home you fragments here whats the matter i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to t i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he were half to half the world by the ears and he upon my party ild revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face what art thou stiff standst out nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners your valour puts well forth pray follow yonder comes news a wager they have met tis done say has our general met the enemy ill buy him of you how far off lie these armies then shall we hear their larum and they ours now mars i prithee make us quick in work that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast   tutus aufidius is he within your walls o they are at it they fear us not but issue forth their city now put your shields before your hearts and fight with hearts more proof than shields advance brave titus they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows he that retires ill take him for a volsce and he shall feel mine edge all the contagion of the south light on you you shames of rome you herd ofboils and plagues plaster you oer that you may be abhorrd further than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men how have you run from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell all hurt behind backs red and faces pale with flight and agued fear mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven ill leave the foe and make my wars on you look tot come on if youll stand fast well beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches followed   so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds tis for the followers fortune widens them not for the fliers mark me and do the like see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crackd drachm cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them and hark what noise the general makes to him there is the man of my souls hate aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius sir praise me not my work hath yet not warmd me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear and fight thy friend no less than those she placeth highest so farewell within                 come i too late come i too late o let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i wood in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burnd to bedward as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threatening the other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common filea plague tribunes for them the mouse neer shunnd the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o the field if not why cease you till you are so how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by the blood we have shed together by the vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour those are they that most are willing if any such be here as it were sin to doubtthat love this painting wherein you see me smeard if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his countrys dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow marcius   o me alone make you a sword of me if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obeyd please you to march and four shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclined ill fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promisebreaker let the first budger die the others slave and the gods doom him after within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioli walls and made what work i pleased tis not my blood wherein thou seest me maskd for thy revenge wrench up thy power to the highest pray now no more my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me i have done as you have done thats what i can induced as you have been thats for my country he that has but effected his good will hath overtaen mine act i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves rememberd i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing may these same instruments which you profane never sound more when drums and trumpets shall i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of falsefaced soothing when steel grows soft as the parasites silk let him be made a coverture for the wars no more i say for that i have not washd my nose that bled or foild some debile wretch which without note heres many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lieswheres caius marcius the news is sir the volsces are in arms they lie in view but have not spoke as yet within this mile and half the citizens of corioli have issued and given to lartius and to marcius battle i saw our party to their trenches driven and then i came away above an hour my lord spies of the volsces held me in chase that i was forced to wheel three or four miles about else had i sir half an hour since brought my report you are sent for to the capitol tis thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he passd the nobles bended as to joves statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senatehouse some news is come that turns their countenances yes worthy sir the slaves report is seconded and more more fearful is deliverd it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not knowthat marcius joind with aufidius leads a power gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngst and oldest thing you are sent for to the senate a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already oerborne their way consumed with fire and took what lay before them sir if yould save your life fly to your house the plebeians have got your fellowtribune and hale him up and down all swearing if the roman ladies bring not comfort home theyll give him death by inches good news good news the ladies have prevaild the volscians are dislodged and marcius gone a merrier day did never yet greet rome no not the expulsion of the tarquinsmarcius tis true that you have lately told us the volsces are in arms then worthy marcius attend upon cominius to these wars so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed our armys in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us farewell no nor a man that fears you less than he thats lesser than a little   hark our drums are bringing forth our youth well break our walls rather than they shall pound us up our gates which yet seem shut we have but pinnd with rushes theyll open of themselves   hark you far off there is aufidius list what work he makes amongst your cloven army sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done he cannot but with measure fit the honours which we devise him tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace to unbuild the city and to lay all flat the gods forbid i prithee noble friend home to thy house leave us to cure this cause noble tribunes it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning pray you lets to him amen amen from whence you may not pass you must return our general will no more hear from thence faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely therefore go back you are a roman are you then you should hate rome as he does can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this no you are deceived therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon now sir is your name menenius a noble fellow i warrant him behold our patroness the life of rome call all your tribes together praise the gods and make triumphant fires strew flowers before them unshout the noise that banishd marcius repeal him with the welcome of his mother cry welcome ladies welcomeyou have fought together it is your former promise noble marcius breathe you my friends well fought we are come off like romans neither foolish in our stands nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs we shall be charged again whiles we have struck by interims and conveying gusts we have heard the charges of our friends ye roman gods lead their successes as we wish our own that both our powers with smiling fronts encountering may give you thankful sacrifice   thy news though thou speakst truth methinks thou speakst not well how long ist since tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour and bring thy news so late whos yonder that does appear as he were flayd o gods he has the stamp of marcius and i have beforetime seen him thus the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour more than i know the sound of marcius tongue from every meaner man ay if you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own flower of warriors how is it with titus lartius where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches where is he call him hither but how prevaild you marcius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose as i guess marcius their bands i the vaward are the antiates of their best trust oer them aufidius their very heart of hope though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action march on my fellows make good this ostentation and you shall divide in all with us if i should tell thee oer this thy days work thouldst not believe thy deeds but ill report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles where great patricians shall attend and shrug i the end admire where ladies shall be frighted and gladly quaked hear more where the dull tribunes that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours shall say against their hearts we thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast having fully dined before you shall not be the grave of your deserving rome must know the value of her own twere a concealment worse than a theft no less than a traducement to hide your doings and to silence that which to the spire and top of praises vouchd would seem but modest therefore i beseech you in sign of what you are not to reward what you have donebefore our army hear me should they not well might they fester gainst ingratitude and tent themselves with death of all the horses whereof we have taen good and good store of all the treasure in this field achieved and city we render you the tenth to be taen forth before the common distribution at your only choice too modest are you more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly by your patience if gainst yourself you be incensed well put you like one that means his proper harm in manacles then reason safely with you therefore be it known as to us to all the world that caius marcius wears this wars garland in token of the which my noble steed known to the camp i give him with all his trim belonging and from this time for what he did before corioli call him with all the applause and clamour of the host caius marcius coriolanus bear the addition nobly ever so to our tent where ere we do repose us we will write to rome of our success you titus lartius must to corioli back send us to rome the best with whom we may articulate for their own good and ours taket tis yours what ist o well beggd were he the butcher of my son he should be free as is the wind deliver him titus go we to our tent the blood upon your visage dries tis time it should be lookd to come look sir your mother ever right on to the capitol i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utterd feebly it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him be bestrid an oerpressd roman and i the consuls view slew three opposers tarquins self he met and struck him on his knee in that days feats when he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man i the field and for his meed was browbound with the oak his pupil age manenterd thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurchd all swords of the garland for this last before and in corioli let me say i cannot speak him home he stoppd the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obeyd and fell below his stem his sword deaths stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enterd the mortal gate of the city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet now alls his when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit requickend what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking oer the lives of men as if twere a perpetual spoil and till we calld both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting our spoils he kickd at and lookd upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again hath he not passd the noble and the common the people are abused set on this paltering becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonourd rub laid falsely i the plain way of his merit twas from the canon well on to the marketplace aged sir hands off that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin help marcius help you that be noble help him young and old stand fast we have as many friends as enemies come sir along with us i could myself take up a brace o the best of them yea the two tribunes but now tis odds beyond arithmetic and manhood is calld foolery when it stands against a falling fabric will you hence before the tag return whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and oerbear what they are used to bear nay come away i have been i the marketplace and sirtis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence alls in anger i think twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit come come well prompt you away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepared with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet well well no more know i pray you hear me my masters and my common friends let me speak i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies marks upon me i do love my countrys good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wifes estimate her wombs increase and treasure of my loins then if i would speak that ill follow thee a month devise with thee where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us and we of thee so if the time thrust forth a cause for thy repeal we shall not send oer the vast world to seek a single man and lose advantage which doth ever cool i the absence of the needer o you have made good work you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonourd to your noses your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confined into an augers bore if he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies he will shake your rome about your ears ay and youll look pale before you find it other all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resist are mockd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools who ist can blame him your enemies and his find something in him who shall ask it the tribunes cannot dot for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say be good to rome they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate and therein showd like enemies you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never so incapable of help but i fear theyll roar him in again tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them ye re goodly things you voices o ay what else he would not seem to know me yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forged himself a name o the fire of burning rome i minded him how royal twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punishd i offerd to awaken his regard fors private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose the offence hell never hear him i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him twas very faintly he said rise dismissd me thus with his speechless hand what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country therefore lets hence and with our fair entreaties haste them onno caius marcius ill lean upon one crutch and fight with tother ere stay behind this business to cominius                lead you on   right worthy you priorityyour company to the capitol where i know our greatest friends attend us to the citizens  hence to your homes be gone speak good cominius leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our states defective for requital than we to stretch it out   masters o the people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here call coriolanus not in this heat sir now no more words we beseech you theres no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish stay whence are you stand and go back be it so go back the virtue of your name is not here passable my general cares not for you back i say go lest i let forth your halfpint of blood backthats the utmost of your having back do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back what cause do you think i have to swoonwas ever man so proud as is this marcius when we were chosen tribunes for the people nay but his taunts bemock the modest moon such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius lets hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action nature teaches beasts to know their friends the lamb especially in pride menenius you are known well enough too on the sudden i warrant him consul he cannot temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to dot tis right i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want if he be put upon t and thats as easy as to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever have with you we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony may they perceives intent he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give the custom of request you have discharged the people do admit you and are summond to meet anon upon your approbation there coriolanus you may sir fare you well   he has it now and by his looks methink tis warm at s heart how now my masters have you chose this man why so he did i am sure why either were you ignorant to seet or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices thus to have said as you were foreadvised had touchd his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluckd either his gracious promise which you might as cause had calld you up have held him to or else it would have galld his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have taen the advantage of his choler and passd him unelected have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your suedfor tongues let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scornd you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you the apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that hes your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation to the capitol come we will be there before the stream o the people and this shall seem as partly tis their own which we have goaded onward pass no further stop or all will fall in broil you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune twere well we let the people knowt it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do this a consul no go call the people   in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator a foe to the public weal obey i charge thee and follow to thine answer help ye citizens heres he that would take from you all your power hear me people peace you are at point to lose your liberties marcius would have all from you marcius whom late you have named for consul what is the city but the people this deserves death therefore lay hold of him bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought peace sir how comest that you have holp to make this rescue consul what consul speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies tonight hes a disease that must be cut away this is clean kam what do ye talk have we not had a taste of his obedience our aediles smote ourselves resisted come noble menenius be you then as the peoples officer masters lay down your weapons meet on the marketplace well attend you there where if you bring not marcius well proceed in our first way have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll have you collected them by tribes assemble presently the people hither and when they bear me say it shall be so i the right and strength o the commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry fine if death cry death insisting on the old prerogative and power i the truth o the cause make them be strong and ready for this hint when we shall hap to give t them well here he comes draw near ye people i do demand if you submit you to the peoples voices allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you answer to us we charge you that you have contrived to take from rome all seasond office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people mark you this people peace we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves the extremest death for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it in the name o the people and in the power of us the tribunes we even from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i the peoples name i say it shall be so hes sentenced no more hearing we know your drift speak what go see him out at gates and follow him as he hath followed you with all despite give him deserved vexation let a guard attend us through the city bid them all home hes gone and well no further the nobility are vexd whom we see have sided in his behalf bid them home say their great enemy is gone and they stand in their ancient strength lets not meet her they say shes mad are  you mankind o blessed heavens what then i would he had continued to his country as he began and not unknit himself the noble knot he made why stay we to be baited with one that wants her wits we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer byt behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly tis hetis he o he is grown most kind of late your coriolanus is not much missd but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it where is he hear you godden our neighbours live and thrive this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion and affecting one sole throne without assistance we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so come what talk you of marcius tell not me i know this cannot be tis this slave go whip him fore the peoples eyeshis raising nothing but his report what more fearful this is most likely the very trick ont go masters get you home be not dismayd these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear nor i pray let us go nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so neverneeded help yet do not upbraids with our distress but sure if you would be your countrys pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman pray you go to him yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well not why what of that ist possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man he loved his mother dearly yes mercy if you report him truly the gods be good unto us whats the news friend art thou certain this is true is it most certain first the gods bless you for your tidings next accept my thankfulness they are near the city we will meet them and help the joyhe has no equal markd you his lip and eyes being moved he will not spare to gird the gods the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant fame at the which he aims in whom already hes well graced can not better be held nor more attaind than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the generals fault though he perform to the utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius o if he had borne the business come half all cominius honours are to marcius though marcius earned them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not lets along good or bad hes a lamb indeed that baes like a bear hes poor in no one fault but stored with all and topping all others in boasting we do it not alone sir what then sir come sir come we know you well enough come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram bout her reechy neck clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smotherd up leads filld and ridges horsed with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him seldshown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station or veild dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture then our office may during his power go sleep in that theres comfort i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i the marketplace nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles tis most like he will so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that tos power he would have made them mules silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them whats the matter lets to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for the time but hearts for the event which the rather we shall be blest to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it sir i hope my words disbenchd you not mark you that you see how he intends to use the people come well inform them of our proceedings here on the marketplace i know they do attend us we stay here for the people with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds will you dismiss the people we pray the gods he may deserve your loves could you not have told him as you were lessond when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i the body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o the state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so lay a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him ay spare us not say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o the marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numas daughters son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our beat water brought by conduits hither and  censorinus  nobly named so twice being  by the people chosen  censor was his great ancestor say you neer had donet harp on that stillbut by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to the capitol let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger it will be dangerous to go on no further cominius no the people are incensed against him callt not a plot the people cry you mockd them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repined scandald the suppliants for the people calld them timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness not to them all how i inform them not unlike each way to better yours you speak o the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice enough with overmeasure has said enough manifest treason the aediles ho   let him be apprehended seize him aediles by the consent of all we were establishd the peoples magistrates or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it we do here pronounce upon the part o the people in whose power we were elected theirs marcius is worthy of present death aediles seize him sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous where the disease is violent lay hands upon him and bear him to the rock lay hands upon him he consul merely awry when he did love his country it honourd him well hear no more pursue him to his house and pluck him thence lest his infection being of catching nature spread further if it were so go not home in this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people and that the spoil got on the antiates was neer distributed   what will he come how accompanied and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence go about it   put him to choler straight he hath been used ever to conquer and to have his worth of contradiction being once chafed he cannot be reind again to temperance then he speaks whats in his heart and that is there which looks with us to break his neck but since he hath served well for rome i talk of that that know it theres no more to be said but he is banishd as enemy to the people and his country it shall be so now we have shown our power let us seem humbler after it is done than when it was adoing dismiss them home   here comes his mother why they have taen note of us keep on your way i would he had pray let us go well well well leave you we stood tot in good time   is this menenius godden to you all godden to you all farewell kind neighbours we wishd coriolanus had loved you as we did caius marcius was a worthy officer i the war but insolent oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking selfloving the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him go see this rumourer whippd it cannot be the volsces dare break with us not possible raised only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again but is this true sir i do not like this news lets to the capitol would half my wealth would buy this for a lie only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your wayis it not yours what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words i think i have the letter here yes here it is   they have pressd a power but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumourd cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither tis bent most likely tis for you consider of it nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veild till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seemd appeard to rome by the discovery we shall be shortend in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honours if we and caius marcius chance to meet tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more and keep your honours safe we hate alike not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot if i fly marcius holloa me like a hare wert thou the hector that was the whip of your braggd progeny thou shouldst not scape me here   officious and not valiant you have shamed me in your condemned seconds the town is taen condition i would i were a roman for i cannot being a volsce be that i am condition what good condition can a treaty find i the part that is at mercy five times marcius i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me and wouldst do so i think should we encounter as often as we eat by the elements if eer again i meet him beard to beard hes mine or i am his mine emulation hath not that honour int it had for where i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword ill potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him bolder though not so subtle my valours poisond with only suffering stain by him for him shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick nor fane nor capitol the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice embarquements all of fury shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom gainst my hate to marcius where i find him were it at home upon my brothers guard even there against the hospitable canon would i wash my fierce hand ins heart go you to the city learn how tis held and what they are that must be hostages for rome i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you tis south the city millsbring me word thither how the world goes that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey where is this fellow whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name why speakst not speak man whats thy name what is thy name say whats thy name thou hast a grim appearance and thy face bears a command int though thy tackles torn thou showst a noble vessel whats thy name i know thee not thy name o marcius marcius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say tis true ild not believe them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarrd the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i loved the maid i married never man sighd truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each others throat and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banishd we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood oerbear o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take the one half of my commission and set down as best thou art experienced since thou knowst thy countrys strength and weaknessthine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than eer an enemy yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome do they still fly to the roman i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in thats no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine wheneer we come to our account all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think hell be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even whether twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controlld the war but one of these as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free himmade him feard so hated and so banishd but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come lets away when caius rome is thine thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine you keep a constant temper only their ends you have respected stoppd your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper

charity slain sir i cannot tell we must proceed as we do find the people i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction i raised him and i pawnd mine honour for his truth who being so heightend he waterd his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bowd his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free that i would have spoke of being banishd fort he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him jointservant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seemd his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary there was it for which my sinews shall be stretchd upon him at a few drops of womens rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die and ill renew me in his fall but hark say no more here come the lords i have not deserved it but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you he approaches you shall hear him read it not noble lords but tell the traitor in the highst degree he hath abused your powers ay traitor marcius ay

certain drops of salt your city rome i say your city to his wife and mother breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk never admitting counsel o the war but at his nurses tears he whined and roard away your victory that pages blushd at him and men of heart lookd wondering each at other name not the god thou boy of tears no more why noble lords will you be put in mind of his

much  power you know the way home again the worthy fellow is our general hes the rock the oak not to be windshakeni pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love when yet he was but tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picturelike to hang by the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action indeed you shall not methinks i hear hither your husbands drum see him pluck aufidius down by the hair as children from a bear the volsces shunning him methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus come on you cowards you were got in fear though you were born in rome his bloody brow with his maild hand then wiping forth he goes like to a harvestman thats taskd to mow or all or lose his hire away you fool it more becomes a man than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba when she did suckle hector lookd not lovelier than hectors forehead when it spit forth blood at grecian sword contemning tell valeria we are fit to bid her welcome hell beat aufidius head below his knee and tread upon his neck sweet madam he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster one on s fathers moods she shall she shall why i pray you let her alone lady as she is now she will but disease our better mirth honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for the love of juno lets go ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous approbation look heres a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and i think theres one at home for you o he is wounded i thank the gods fort ons brows menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off good ladies lets go yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly true pow wow i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i the body he had before this last expedition twentyfive wounds upon him these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie which being advanced declines and then men die nay my good soldier up my gentle marcius worthy caius and by deedachieving honour newly named what is itcoriolanus must i call thee but o thy wife i know not where to turn o welcome home and welcome general and yere welcome all i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only theres one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not showd them how ye were disposed ere they lackd power to cross you pray be counselld i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unseverd friends i the war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by the other lose that they combine not there if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosoms truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretchd ithere be with them thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the earswaving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person prithee now go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower here is cominius he must and will prithee now say you will and go about it i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before at thy choice then to beg of thee it is my more dishonour than thou of them come all to ruin let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me but owe thy pride thyself do your will now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome and occupations perish my first son whither wilt thou go take good cominius with thee awhile determine on some course more than a wild exposture to each chance that starts i the way before thee o yere well met the hoarded plague o the gods requite your love if that i could for weeping you should hear nay and you shall hear some   will you be gone ay fool is that a shame note but this fool was not a man my father hadst thou foxship to banish him that struck more blows for rome than thou hast spoken words more noble blows than ever thou wise words and for romes good ill tell thee what yet go nay but thou shalt stay too i would my son were in arabia and thy tribe before him his good sword in his hand bastards and all good man the wounds that he does bear for rome i would he had twas you incensed the rabble cats that can judge as fitly of his worth as i can of those mysteries which heaven will not have earth to know now pray sir get you gone you have done a brave deed ere you go hear this as far as doth the capitol exceed the meanest house in rome so far my son this ladys husband here this do you see whom you have banishd does exceed you all take my prayers with you   i would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses could i meet em but once aday it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy tot angers my meat i sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding come lets go leave this faint puling and lament as i do in anger junolike come come come o stand up blest whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee do you know this lady this is a poor epitome of yours which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself your knee sirrah even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you o no more no more you have said you will not grant us any thing for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his countrys bowels out and to poor we thine enmitys most capital thou barrst us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles thorough our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and childrens blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread trust tot thou shalt noton thy mothers womb that brought thee to this world nay go not from us thus if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honour no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say this mercy we have showd the romans this we received and each in either side give the allhail to thee and cry be blest for making up this peace thou knowst great son the end of wars uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be doggd with curses whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble but with his last attempt he wiped it out destroyd his country and his name remains to the ensuing age abhorrd speak to me son thou hast affected the fine strains of honour to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak why dost not speak thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons theres no man in the world more bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate like one i the stocks thou hast never in thy life showd thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen fond of no second brood has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home loaden with honour say my requests unjust and spurn me back but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrainst from me the duty which to a mothers part belongs he turns away down ladies let us shame him with our knees to his surname coriolanus longs more pride than pity to our prayers down an end this is the last so we will home to rome and die among our neighbours nay behold s this boy that cannot tell what he would have but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny t come let us go this fellow had a volscian to his mother his wife is in corioli

they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever this lies glowing i can tell you and is almost mature for the violent breaking out banished sir the day serves well for them now i have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a mans wife is when shes fallen out with her husband your noble tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars his great opposer coriolanus being now in no request of his country i shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from rome all tending to the good of their adversaries have you an army

mans house he used me kindly he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was with in my view and wrath oerwhelmd my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom by jupiter forgot i am weary yea my memory is tired have we no wine here no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more o you have i know petitiond all the gods for my prosperity my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laughd had i come coffind home that weepst to see me triumph ay my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons and live you yet   o my sweet lady pardon menenius ever ever to volumnia and virgilia  your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honours know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs your horrors pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monsterd i do owe them still my life and services i do beseech you let me oerleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing it is apart that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only what must i say i pray sirplague upont i cannot bring my tongue to such a pacelook sir my wounds i got them in my countrys service when some certain of your brethren roard and ran from the noise of our own drums think upon me hang em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by em bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean   so here comes a brace   you know the cause air of my standing here mine own desert ay but not mine own desire no sirtwas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging well then i pray your price o the consulship kindly sir i pray let me hat i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you a match sir theres in all two worthy voices begged i have your alms adieu pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown your enigma you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches custom calls me tot what custom wills in all things should we dot the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to oerpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part sufferd the other will i do   here come more voices your voices for your voices i have fought watchd for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul worthy voices is this done where at the senatehouse may i change these garments that ill straight do and knowing myself again repair to the senatehouse tullus aufidius then had made new head so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upons again saw you aufidius spoke he of me how what at antium lives he i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home   behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance ha what is that what makes this change have i had childrens voices are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffert and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled why this was known before have you informd them sithence you are like to do such business why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speakt again now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rankscented many let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have ploughd for sowd and scatterd by mingling them with us the honourd number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tatter us yet sought the very way to catch them choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove twould be my mind shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o the monsters wants not spirit to say hell turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learnd be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the greatst taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frown in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used sometime in greece though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourishd disobedience fed the ruin of the state ill give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured that neer did service fort being pressd to the war even when the navel of the state was touchd they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i the war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showd most valour spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the motive of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bisson multitude digest the senates courtesy let deeds express whats like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignoranceit must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barrd it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change ont that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic thats sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should becomet not having the power to do the good it would for the in which doth controlt thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion when whats not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i the dust hence old goat senators   cwell surety him hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments no ill die here   theres some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me i would they were barbariansas they are though in rome litterdnot romansas they are not though calved i the porch o the capitol on fair ground i could beat forty of them let them puff all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war   i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am let go let them hang what must i do well what then what then for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then dot to them tush tush why force you this must i go show them my unbarbed sconce must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will dot yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throwt against the wind to the marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life well i must dot away my disposition and possess me some harlots spirit my throat of war be turnd which quired with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggars tongue make motion through my lips and my armd knees who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not dot lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my bodys action teach my mind a most inherent baseness pray be content mother i am going to the marketplace chide me no more ill mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife ill return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i the way of flattery further the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour well mildly be it then mildly ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece will bear the knave by the volume the honourd gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among s throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war first hear me speak shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here i am content scratches with briers scars to move

o the rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumour shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making not reservation of yourselves

make invincible the heart that connd them nay prithee woman what what what i shall be loved when i am lackd nay mother resume that spirit when you were wont to say if you had been the wife of hercules

town ill enter if he slay me he does fair justice if he give me way ill do his country service a goodly house the feast smells well but i appear not like a guest i have deserved no better entertainment in being coriolanus away now thourt troublesome let me but stand i will not hurt your hearth a gentleman true so i am follow your function go and batten on cold bits under the canopy ay i the city of kites and crows no i serve not thy master ay tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress thou pratest and pratest serve with thy trencher hence if tullus   not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself a name unmusical to the volscians ears and harsh in sound to thine prepare thy brow to frown knowst thou me yet my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devourd the rest and sufferd me by the voice of slaves to be whoopd out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope mistake me notto save my life for if i had feard death of all the men i the world i would have voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cankerd country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes thourt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followd thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service you bless me gods whats the matter away wife mother child i know not my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much therefore be gone mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force yet for i loved thee take this along i writ it for thy sake   and would have rent it another word menenius i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius was my beloved in rome yet thou beholdst we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host my partner in this action you must report to the volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business this last old man whom with a crackd heart i have sent to rome loved me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have though i showd sourly to him once more offerd the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to ha what shout is this   shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time tis made i will not   my wife comes foremost then the honourd mould wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate what is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy ill never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin these eyes are not the same i wore in rome like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgind it eer since you gods i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink my knee i the earth   of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons what is this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun murdering impossibility to make what cannot be slight work the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle thats curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dians temple dear valeria the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars like a great seamark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee thats my brave boy i beseech you peace or if yould ask remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with romes mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not to ally my rages and revenges with your colder reasons aufidius and you volsces mark for well hear nought from rome in private your request not of a womans tenderness to be requires nor child nor womans face to see i have sat too long o mother mother what have you done behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at o my mother mother o you have won a happy victory to rome but for your sonbelieve it o believe it most dangerously you have with him prevaild if not most mortal to him but let it come aufidius though i cannot make true wars ill frame convenient peace now good aufidius were you in my stead would you have heard a mother less or granted less aufidius i dare be sworn you were and sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir what peace youll make advise me for my part ill not to rome ill back with you and pray you stand to me in this cause o mother wife ay by and by   but we will drink together and you shall bear a better witness back than words which we on like conditions will have counterseald come enter with us ladies you deserve to have a temple built you all the swords in italy and her confederate arms could not have made this peace hail lords i am returnd your soldier no more infected with my countrys love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home do more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to the romans and we here deliver subscribed by the consuls and patricians together with the seal o the senate what we have compounded on traitor how now marcius hearst thou mars ha measureless liar thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it boy o slave pardon me lords tis the first time that ever i was forced to scold your judgments my grave lords must give this cur the lie and his own notion who wears my stripes impressd upon him that must bear my beating to his graveshall join to thrust the lie unto him cut me to pieces volsces men and lads stain all your edges on me boy false hound if you have writ your annals true tis there that like an eagle in a dovecote i flutterd your volscians in corioli alone i did it boy o that i had him with six aufidiuses or more his tribe to use my lawful swordwell sir why how are we censured well well sir wellknow rome that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates where he hath won with fame a name to caius marcius these in honour follows coriolanus welcome to rome renowned coriolanus give way there and go oncome come they are almost here how many stand for consulships three they say but tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love he doth appearthats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people no more of him he is a worthy man make way they are comingfaith there had been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard itto coriolanus come all joy and honourwe have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o the compass nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans willtis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but if it were at liberty twould sure southward to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife are you all resolved to give your voices but thats no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man   here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behavior we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes hes to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and i direct you how you shall go by him how not your own desire but this is something odd certainly he flouted us downright he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn i would be consul says he aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore when we granted that here was i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices i have no further with you was not this mockery hes not confirmd we may deny him yetyou have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people you have received many wounds for your countrythe gods

centurions and their charges distinctly billeted already in the entertainment and to be on foot at an hours warning you take my part from me sir i have the most cause to be glad of yourswine wine wine what service is here i think our fellows are asleep wheres cotus my master calls for him cotus whence are you sir has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions pray get you out what fellows this a strange one as ever i looked on i cannot get him out of the house prithee call my master to him pray you poor gentleman take up some other station heres no place for you pray you avoid come what you will not prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here under the canopy wheres that here sir ild have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords within i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on nay its no matter for that nay not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier faith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals wherefore wherefore why heres he that was wont to thwack our general caius marcius why do you say thwack our general and hes as like to dot as any man i can imagine why then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed balladmakers let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night its spritely waking audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than wars a destroyer of men ay and it makes men hate one anotherwhat would you have friend whence are you heres no place for you pray go to the door heres a strange alteration what an arm he has he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top he had so looking as it werewould i were hanged but i thought there was more in him than i could think ay and for an assault too he was too hard for him directly to say the troth ont before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado but more of thy news directitude whats that but when goes this forwardaway get you away are you so brave ill have you talked with anon and i shall by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him nay i knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methoughti cannot tell how to term it so did i ill be sworn he is simply the rarest man i the world who my master worth six on him what what what lets partake come we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself an he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckoldswhat have you to do here fellow pray you avoid the house what are you a marvellous poor one where dwellest thou i the city of kites and crows what an ass it is then thou dwellest with daws too how sir do you meddle with my master i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lieve be a condemned man i do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself withs hand and turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table hell go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled dot he will dot for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst hes in directitude but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel all with him tomorrow today presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips reason because they then less need one another the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians they are rising they are risinghail sir say not we brought ita shall not tread on me ill run away till i am bigger but then ill fightas certain as i know the sun is fire where have you lurkd that you make doubt of it neer through an arch so hurried the blown tide as the recomforted through the gates why hark you   the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans make the sun dance hark you sir we have all great cause to give great thanks almost at point to enterhow is it with our general so he did my lord the army marvelld at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we lookd for no less spoil than glory your native town you enterd like a post and had no welcomes home but he returns splitting the air with noisemost noble sir if you do hold the same intent wherein you wishd us parties well deliver you of your great danger and patient fools whose children he hath slain their base throats tear with giving him glorythe people will remain uncertain whilst twixt you theres difference but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of allsir his stoutness when he did stand for consul which he lost by lack of stooping therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let him feel your sword which we will second when he lies along after your way his tale pronounced shall bury his reasons with his bodyyou are most welcome homewe have hold hold hold holdand grieve to heart what faults he made before the last i think might have found easy fines but there to end where he was to begin and give away the benefit of our levies answering us with our own charge making a treaty where there was a yieldingthis admits no excuse peace both and hear me speak o tullus bear from hence his body and mourn you for him let him be regarded as the most noble corse that ever herald did follow to his urnlet him die fort kill kill kill kill kill himtear him to pieces do it presently he killd my son my daughter he killed my cousin marcus he killed my fatherpeace ho no outrage peace the man is noble and his fame foldsin this orb o the earth his last offences to us shall have judicious hearing stand aufidius and trouble not the peace thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep his own impatience takes from aufidius a great part of blame lets make the best of ittread not upon him masters all be quiet put up your swords
