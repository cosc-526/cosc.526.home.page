i learn in this letter that don peter of arragon comes this night to messina how many gentlemen have you lost in this action a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers i find here that don peter hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it did he break out into tears a kind overflow of kindness there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping what is he that you ask for niece faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but hell be meet with you i doubt it not you must not sir mistake my niece there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but theres a skirmish of wit between them you will never run mad niece never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave her mother hath many times told me so signior benedick no for then were you a child if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn   let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother i owe you all duty please it your grace lead on how now brother where is my cousin your son hath he provided this music are they good hath the fellow any wit that told you this no no we will

in count johns mouth and half count johns melancholy in signior benedicks face by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue so by being too curst god will

hath made the match and an grace say amen to it niece will you look to those things i told you of theres little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing o by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit o lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad not till monday my dear son which is hence a just sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights watchings no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it what effects my lord she will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick no and swears she never will thats her torment this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for shell be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her i measure him says she by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself it is very true o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian were it good think you if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first my lord will you walk dinner is ready so say imethinks you are sadder where is but a humour or a worm indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard what would you with me honest neighbour brief i pray you for you see it is a busy time with me what is it my good friends neighbours you are tedious all thy tediousness on me ah i would fain know what you have to say indeed neighbour he comes too short of you i must leave you take their examination yourself and bring it me i am now in great haste as it may appear unto you drink some wine ere you go fare you well ill wait upon them i am ready come friar francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards to be married to her friar you come to marry her i dare make his answer none as freely son as god did give her me what do you mean my lord dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquishd the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity sweet prince why speak not you are these things spoken or do i but dream all this is so but what of this my lord i charge thee do so as thou art my child hath no mans dagger here a point for me o fate take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wishd for dost thou look up wherefore why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal natures frame o one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggars issue at my gates who smirchd thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of herwhy she o she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foultainted flesh confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made which was before barrd up with ribs of iron would the two princes lie and claudio lie who loved her so that speaking of her foulness washd it with tears hence from her let her die friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it why seekst thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness i know not if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awaked in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly what shall become of this what will this do being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve give not me counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine and bid him speak of patience measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain as thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candlewasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial medicine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words no no tis all mens office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no mans virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement i pray thee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance there thou speakst reason nay i will do so my soul doth tell me hero is belied and that shall claudio know so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonour her hear you my lords some haste my lord well fare you well my lord are you so hasty now well all is one marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword i fear thee not tush tush man never fleer and jest at me i speak not like a dotard nor a fool as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young or what would do were i not old know claudio to thy head thou hast so wrongd mine innocent child and me that i am forced to lay my reverence by and with grey hairs and bruise of many days do challenge thee to trial of a man i say thou hast belied mine innocent child thy slander hath gone through and through her heart and she lies buried with her ancestors o in a tomb where never scandal slept save this of hers framed by thy villany thine claudio thine i say my lord my lord ill prove it on his body if he dare despite his nice fence and his active practise his may of youth and bloom of lustihood canst thou so daff me thou hast killd my child if thou killst me boy thou shalt kill a man brother brother antony but brother antony my lord my lord no come brother away i will be heard which is the villain let me see his eyes that

honourable men a third is fled that had a hand in it i thank you princes for my daughters death record it with your high and worthy deeds twas bravely done if you bethink you of it i cannot bid you

tomb and sing it to her bones sing it tonight tomorrow morning come you to my house and since you could not be my soninlaw be yet my nephew my brother hath a daughter almost the copy of my child thats dead and she alone is heir to both of us give her the right you should have given her cousin and so dies my revenge tomorrow then i will expect your coming tonight i take my leave this naughty man

thy prisoner and i thank thee until tomorrow morning lords farewell to the watch  bring you these fellows on well talk with margaret how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow so are the prince and claudio who accused her upon the error that you heard debated but margaret was in some fault for this although against her will as it appears in the true course of all the question well daughter and you gentlewomen all withdraw into a chamber by yourselves and when i send for you come hither maskd   the prince and claudio promised by this hour to visit me you know your office brother you must be father to your brothers daughter and give her to young claudio that eye my daughter lent her tis most true the sight whereof i think you had from me from claudio and the prince but whats your will my heart is with your liking good morrow prince good morrow claudio we here attend you are you yet determined today to marry with my brothers daughter call her forth brother heres the friar ready no that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her she died my lord but whiles her slander lived come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman well have dancing afterwardhe is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him but few of any sort and none of name much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness in great measure i know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort o hes returned and as pleasant as ever he was he hath done good service lady in these wars and a good soldier too lady a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues ist possible i see lady the gentleman is not in your books he is most in the company of the right noble claudio i will hold friends with you lady don pedro is approached my lord they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband my lord your brother john is taen in flight and brought with armed men back to messinai pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncles fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the birdbolt i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars but how many hath he killed for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffingwell we are all mortal alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature who is his companion now he hath every month a new sworn brother very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block no an he were i would burn my study but i pray you who is his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad god help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured do good friend no not till a hot january i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humour for that i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as yours were a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours you always end with a jades trick i know you of old how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a could get her goodwill too curst is more than curst i shall lessen gods sending that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns but to a cow too curst he sends none just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening lord i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make him my waitinggentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearward and lead his apes into hell no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven heres no place for you maids so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long yes faith it is my cousins duty to make curtsy and say father as it please you but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say father as it please me not till god make men of some other metal than earth would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl no uncle ill none adams sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in every thing and so dance out the answer for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinque pace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerlymodest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque pace faster and faster till he sink into his grave i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight will you not tell me who told you so nor will you not tell me who you are that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry taleswell this was signior benedick that said so i am sure you know him well enough did he never make you laugh why he is the princes jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me do do hell but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then theres a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night   we must follow the leaders nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for his single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion speak count tis your cue speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart good lord for alliance thus goes every one to the world but i and i am sunburnt i may sit in a corner and cry heighho for a husband i would rather have one of your fathers getting hath your grace neer a brother like you your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them no my lord unless i might have another for workingdays your grace is too costly to wear every day but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born cousins god give you joy i cry you mercy uncle by your graces pardon against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come yea just so much as you may take upon a knifes point and choke a daw withal you have no stomach signior fare you well coming forward what fire is in mine ears can this be true stand i condemnd for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly good morrow sweet hero i am out of all other tune methinks ye light o love with your heels then if your husband have stables enough youll see he shall lack no barns tis almost five oclock cousin tis time you were ready by my troth i am exceeding ill heighho for the letter that begins them all h what means the fool trow i am stuffed cousin i cannot smell o god help me god help me how long have you professed apprehension it is not seen enough you should wear it in your cap by my troth i am sick benedictus why benedictus you have some moral in this benedictus what pace is this that thy tongue keeps why how now cousin wherefore sink you down dead i think help uncle hero why hero uncle signior benedick friar how now cousin hero o on my soul my cousin is belied no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow yea and i will weep a while longer you have no reason i do it freely ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her a very even way but no such friend it is a mans office but not yours as strange as the thing i know not it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing i am sorry for my cousin do not swear and eat it will you not eat your word why then god forgive me you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest kill claudio you kill me to deny it farewell i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go in faith i will go you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the marketplace talk with a man out at a window a proper saying sweet hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone princes and counties surely a princely testimony a goodly count count comfect a sweet gallant surely o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into courtesies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving use it for my love some other way than swearing by it yea as sure as i have a thought or a soul yea signior and depart when you bid me then is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me in spite of your heart i think alas poor heart if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates it appears not in this confession theres not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself and how long is that think you very ill very ill too will you go hear this news signior unmasking  i answer to that name what is your will why no no more than reason do not you love me why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceived for they did swear you did they swore that you were wellnigh dead for me no truly but in friendly recompense i would not deny you but by this good day i yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for i was told you were in a consumptionmy cousin means signior benedick of padua he is of a very melancholy disposition so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away i may say so when i please when i like your favour for god defend the lute should be like the case why then your visor should be thatched i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband good margaret run thee to the parlor there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheardst us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripend by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose  this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay   now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it   no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggerds of the rock so says the prince and my newtrothed lord they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they loved benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a womans heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so selfendeared why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward if fairfaced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antique made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like coverd fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly ill devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio indeed he hath an excellent good name why every day tomorrow come go in ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow if it proves so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps good ursula wake my cousin beatrice and desire her to rise and bid her come hither no pray thee good meg ill wear this my cousins a fool and thou art another ill wear none but this o that exceeds they say god give me joy to wear it for my heart is exceeding heavy fie upon thee art not ashamed good morrow coz why how now do you speak in the sick tune these gloves the count sent me they are an excellent perfume there thou prickest her with a thistle help to dress me good coz good meg good ursula i do none my lord and seemd i ever otherwise to you is my lord well that he doth speak so wide true o god o god defend me how am i beset what kind of catechising call you this is it not hero who can blot that name with any just reproach i talkd with no man at that hour my lord they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintaind the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death and when i lived i was your other wife   and when you loved you were my other husband nothing certainer one hero died defiled but i do live and surely as i live i am a maid and heres another writ in my cousins hand stolen from her pocket containing her affection unto benedickgood signior leonato you are come to meet

notes forsooth and nothing by my troth a good song ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift do so farewell   come hither leonato what was it you told me of today that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick may be she doth but counterfeit hath she made her affection known to benedick it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it an he should it were an alms to hang him shes an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous in every thing but in loving benedick i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what a will say he hath indeed a good outward happiness he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumbshow let us send her to call him in to dinner i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon what sigh for the toothache there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a

continuer but keep your way i gods name i have done i noted her not but i looked on her do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex why i faith methinks shes too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her would you buy her that you inquire after her yea and a case to put it into but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good harefinder and vulcan a rare carpenter come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter theres her cousin an she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december but i hope you have no intent to

thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away sundays look don pedro is returned to seek you i would your grace would constrain me to tell you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love with who now that is your graces part mark how short his answer iswith hero leonatos short daughter like the old tale my lord it is not so nor twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is for the which i may go the finer i will live a bachelor with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a balladmakers pen and hang me up at the door of a brothelhouse for the sign of blind cupid if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear it pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write here is good horse to hire let them signify under my sign here you may see benedick the married man i look for an earthquake too then i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so i commit you nay mock not mock not the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so i leave you no you shall pardon me not now whats he not i believe me i pray you what is he when i know the gentleman ill tell him what you say in every good thing count claudio come will you go with me even to the next willow about your own business county what fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an usurers chain or under your arm like a lieutenants scarf you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero why thats spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks but did you think the prince would have served you thus ho now you strike like the blind man twas the boy that stole your meat and youll beat the post alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me the princes fool ha it may be i go under that title because i am merry yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out well ill be revenged as i may troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willowtree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped the flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a birds nest shows it his companion and he steals it yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his birds nest if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly o she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the princes jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam bad left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follows her will your grace command me any service to the worlds end i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester johns foot fetch you a hair off the great chams beard do you any embassage to the pigmies rather than hold three words conference with this harpy you have no employment for me o god sir heres a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue boy in my chamberwindow lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard i know that but i would have thee hence and here again   i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but ill take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be thats certain wise or ill none virtuous or ill never cheapen her fair or ill   never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please god ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in the arbour now divine air now is his soul ravished is it not strange that sheeps guts should hale souls out of mens bodies well a horn for my money when alls done an he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief i had as lief have heard the nightraven come what plague could have come after it ist possible sits the wind in that corner i should think this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide himself in such reverence coming forward  this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent love me why it must be requited i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world must be peopled when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here comes beatrice by this day shes a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her fair beatrice i thank you for your pains you take pleasure then in the message ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner theres a double meaning in that i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me thats as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew i will go get her picture gallants i am not as i have been i have the toothache hang it well every one can master a grief but he that has it yet is this no charm for the toothache old signior walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobbyhorses must not hear how now interjections why then some be of laughing as ah ha he this looks not like a nuptial how doth the lady sir sir be patient for my part i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say lady were you her bedfellow last night two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practise of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villanies signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body lady beatrice have you wept all this while i will not desire that surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged is there any way to show such friendship may a man do it i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange by my sword beatrice thou lovest me i will swear by it that you love me and i will make him eat it that says i love not you with no sauce that can be devised to it i protest i love thee what offence sweet beatrice and do it with all thy heart come bid me do any thing for thee ha not for the wide world tarry sweet beatrice beatrice well be friends first is claudio thine enemy hear me beatrice nay but beatrice beat tarry good beatrice by this hand i love thee think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero enough i am engaged i will challenge him i will kiss your hand and so i leave you by this hand claudio shall render me a dear account as you hear of me so think of me go comfort your cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell good day my lord in a false quarrel there is no true valour i came to seek you both it is in my scabbard shall i draw it sir i shall meet your wit in the career and you charge it against me i pray you choose another subject shall i speak a word in your ear aside to claudio  you are a villain i jest not i will make it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dare do me right or i will protest your cowardice you have killed a sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you let me hear from you sir your wit ambles well it goes easily fare you well boy you know my mind i will leave you now to your gossiplike humour you break jests as braggarts do their blades which god be thanked hurt not my lord for your many courtesies i thank you i must discontinue your company your brother the bastard is fled from messina you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady for my lord lackbeard there he and i shall meet and till then peace be with him pray thee sweet mistress margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice in so high a style margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it thy wit is as quick as the greyhounds mouth it catches a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a woman and so i pray thee call beatrice i give thee the bucklers if you use them margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids and therefore will come     the god of love that sits above and knows me and knows me how pitiful i deserve i mean in singing but in loving leander the good swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and a whole bookful of these quondam carpetmangers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love marry i cannot show it in rhyme i have tried i can find out no rhyme to lady but baby an innocent rhyme for scorn horn a hard rhyme for school fool a babbling rhyme very ominous endings no i was not born under a rhyming planet nor i cannot woo in festival terms   sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee o stay but till then only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit but i must tell thee plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe him a coward and i pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me suffer love a good epithet i do suffer love indeed for i love thee against my will thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably an old an old instance beatrice that lived in the lime of good neighbours if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise if don worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as i am to myself so much for praising myself who i myself will bear witness is praiseworthy and now tell me how doth your cousin and how do you serve god love me and mend there will i leave you too for here comes one in haste i will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried in thy eyes and moreover i will go with thee to thy uncles and so am i being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it friar i must entreat your pains i think to bind me or undo me one of them signior leonato truth it is good signior your niece regards me with an eye of favour and i do with an eye of love requite her your answer sir is enigmatical but for my will my will is your good will may stand with ours this day to be conjoind in the state of honourable marriage in which good friar i shall desire your help bull jove sir had an amiable low and some such strange bull leapd your fathers cow and got a calf in that same noble feat much like to you for you have just his bleat soft and fair friar which is beatrice do not you love me why then your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived they swore you did troth no no more than reason they swore that you were almost sick for me tis no such matter then you do not love me a miracle heres our own hands against our hearts come i will have thee but by this light i take thee for pity peace i will stop your mouth ill tell thee what prince a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour dost thou think i  care for a satire or an epigram no if a man will be beaten with brains a shall wear nothing handsome about him in brief since i do purpose to marry i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what i have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion for thy part claudio i did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin come come we are friends lets have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives heels first of my word therefore play music prince thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn think not on him till tomorrow ill devise thee brave punishments for him strike up pipersi thank you i am not of many words but i thank you there is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit i wonder that thou being as thou sayest thou art born under saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief i cannot hide what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile at no mans jests eat when i have stomach and wait for no mans leisure sleep when i am drowsy and tend on no mans business laugh when i am merry and claw no man in his humour i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plaindealing villain i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me i make all use of it for i use it only who comes here   what news borachio will it serve for any model to build mischief on what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness who the most exquisite claudio a proper squire and who and who which way looks he a very forward marchchick how came you to this come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure that young startup hath all the glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i bless myself every way you are both sure and will assist me sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it the ladies follow her and but one visor remains are not you signior benedick signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it i heard him swear his affection come let us to the banquet it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine how canst thou cross this marriage show me briefly how i remember what life is in that to be the death of this marriage what proof shall i make of that only to despite them i will endeavour any thing grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in practise be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats my lord and brother god save you if it please you yet count claudio may hear for what i would speak of concerns him you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will manifest for my brother i think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriagesurely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed i came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened for she has been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal the word is too good to paint out her wickedness i could say she were worse think you of a worse title and i will fit her to it wonder not till further warrant go but with me tonight you shall see her chamberwindow entered even the night before her weddingday if you love her then tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself o plague right well prevented so will you say when you have seen the sequel sir they are spoken and these things are true fie fie they are not to be named my lord not to be spoke of there is not chastity enough in language without offence to utter them thus pretty lady i am sorry for thy much misgovernment come let us go these things come thus to light smother her spirits upbenedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato is she not a modest young lady no i pray thee speak in sober judgment thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her can the world buy such a jewel in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn the contrary if hero would be my wife if this were so so were it uttered if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be otherwise you speak this to fetch me in my lord and in faith my lord i spoke mine that i love her i feel and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will if this should ever happen thou wouldst be hornmad to the tuition of god from my house if i had it my liege your highness now may do me good hath leonato any son my lord o my lord when you went onward on this ended action i lookd upon her with a soldiers eye that liked but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am returnd and that warthoughts have left their places vacant in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires all prompting me how fair young hero is saying i liked her ere i went to wars how sweetly you do minister to love that know loves grief by his complexion but lest my liking might too sudden seem i would have salved it with a longer treatise you know me well i am he how know you he loves her thus answer i in the name of benedick but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio tis certain so the prince wooes for himself friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not farewell therefore hero yea the same whither i wish him joy of her i pray you leave me if it will not be ill leave you not sad my lord neither my lord silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy if i could say how much lady as you are mine i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange and so she doth cousin tomorrow my lord time goes on crutches till love have all his rites and i my lord yea my good lord how still the evening is as hushd on purpose to grace harmony o very well my lord the music ended well fit the kidfox with a pennyworth o ay stalk on stalk on the fowl sits i did never think that lady would have loved any man faith like enough bait the hook well this fish will bite she did indeed he hath taen the infection hold it up tis true indeed so your daughter says shall i says she that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that i love him now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of that then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses o sweet benedick god give me patience to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse and she is exceeding wise hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness he is a very proper man before god and in my mind very wise and i take him to be valiant never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me i hope he be in love you must hang it first and draw it afterwards yet say i he is in love if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a brushes his hat o mornings what should that bode no but the barbers man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennisballs thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love and when was he wont to wash his face nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now governed by stops nay but i know who loves him yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him tis even so hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet if there be any impediment i pray you discover it who hero disloyal may this be so if i see any thing tonight why i should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i shame her o mischief strangely thwarting no know you any hero o what men dare do what men may do what men daily do not knowing what they do stand thee by friar father by your leave will you with free and unconstrained soul give me this maid your daughter and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness there leonato take her back again give not this rotten orange to your friend shes but the sign and semblance of her honour behold how like a maid she blushes here o what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue would you not swear all you that see her that she were a maid by these exterior shows but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed her blush is guiltiness not modesty not to be married not to knit my soul to an approved wanton i know what you would say if i have known her you will say she did embrace me as a husband and so extenuate the forehand sin no leonato i never tempted her with word too large but as a brother to his sister showd bashful sincerity and comely love out on thee seeming i will write against it you seem to me as dian in her orb as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus or those pamperd animals that rage in savage sensuality leonato stand i here is this the prince is this the princes brother is this face heros are our eyes our own let me but move one question to your daughter and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her bid her answer truly to make you answer truly to your name marry that can hero hero itself can blot out heros virtue what man was he talkd with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one now if you are a maid answer to this o hero what a hero hadst thou been if half thy outward graces had been placed about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell thou pure impiety and impious purity for thee ill lock up all the gates of love and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm and never shall it more be gracious good day to both of you who wrongs him marry beshrew my hand if it should give your age such cause of fear in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword my villany away i will not have to do with you now signior what news we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth we have been up and down to seek thee for we are highproof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away wilt thou use thy wit never any did so though very many have been beside their wit i will bid thee draw as we do the minstrels draw to pleasure us what courage man what though care killed a cat thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care nay then give him another staff this last was broke cross if he be he knows how to turn his girdle god bless me from a challenge well i will meet you so i may have good cheer i faith i thank him he hath bid me to a calfs head and a capon the which if i do not carve most curiously say my knifes naught shall i not find a woodcock too for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not all all and moreover god saw him when he was hid in the garden yea and text underneath here dwells benedick the married man in most profound earnest and ill warrant you for the love of beatrice most sincerely he is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man hearken after their offence my lord rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth theres one meaning well suited i have drunk poison whiles he utterd it sweet hero now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i loved it first i know not how to pray your patience yet i must speak choose your revenge yourself impose me to what penance your invention can lay upon my sin yet sinnd i not but in mistaking o noble sir your overkindness doth wring tears from me i do embrace your offer and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio tonight ill mourn with hero is this the monument of leonato reading out of a scroll done to death by slanderous tongues was the hero that here lies death in guerdon of her wrongs gives her fame which never dies so the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame hang thou there upon the tomb praising her when i am dumb now music sound and sing your solemn hymn song pardon goddess of the night those that slew thy virgin knight for the which with songs of woe round about her tomb they go midnight assist our moan help us to sigh and groan heavily heavily graves yawn and yield your dead till death be uttered heavily heavily now unto thy bones good night yearly will i do this rite good morrow masters each his several way and hymen now with luckier issue speeds than this for whom we renderd up this woe ill hold my mind were she an ethiope i

this i owe you here comes other reckonings   which is the lady i must seize upon why then shes mine sweet let me see your face give me your hand before this holy friar i am your husband if you like of me another hero and ill be sworn upont that he loves her for heres a paper written in his hand a halting sonnet of his own pure brain fashiond to beatrice i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life to make thee a doubledealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to theewhat secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonatos amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy what need the bridge much broader than the flood the fairest grant is the necessity look what will serve is fit tis once thou lovest and i will fit thee with the remedy i know we shall have revelling tonight i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio and in her bosom ill unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale then after to her father will i break and the conclusion is she shall be thine in practise let us put it presently now signior wheres the count did you see him the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you how then sick come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us i will in the interim undertake one of hercules labours which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction and you too gentle hero come shall we hear this music come balthasar well hear that song again it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection i pray thee sing and let me woo no more yea marry dost thou hear balthasar i pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady heros chamberwindow why what effects of passion shows she how how pray you you amaze me i would have i thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection she doth well if she should make tender of her love tis very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks hang him truant theres no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love if he be sad he wants money draw it she shall be buried with her face upwards for my life to break with him about beatrice you know he does why whats the matter i will not think it good den good den we have some haste leonato i will not hear you see see here comes the man we went to seek welcome signior you are almost come to part almost a fray but when shall we set the savage bulls horns on

not say my brother was fled the former hero hero that is deadhe is very busy about it but brother i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of as the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward the prince and count claudio walking in a thickpleached alley in mine orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it a good sharp fellow i will send for him and question him yourself i saw him not in faith shes too curst to hero  well niece i trust you will be ruled by your father at a word i am not to tell you true i counterfeit him at a word i am not if you go on thus you will kill yourself and tis not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself therein do men from children nothing differ yet bend not all the harm upon yourself make those that do offend you suffer too here comes the prince and claudio hastily if he could right himself with quarreling some of us would lie low he shall kill two of us and men indeed but thats no matter let him kill one first win me and wear me let him answer me come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me sir boy ill whip you from your foining fence nay as i am a gentleman i will content yourself god knows i loved my niece and she is dead slanderd to death by villains that dare as well answer a man indeed as i dare take a serpent by the tongue boys apes braggarts jacks milksops hold you content what man i know them yea and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple scrambling outfacing fashionmonging boys that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander go anticly show outward hideousness and speak off half a dozen dangerous words how they might hurt their enemies if they durst and this is all come tis no matter do not you meddle let me deal in this and shall or some of us will smart for it farewell my lords we look for you tomorrow well i am glad that all things sort so well which i will do with confirmd countenance this same is she and i do give you herwhat the goodyear my lord why are you thus out of measure sad you should hear reason if not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment you have of late stood out against your brother and he hath taen you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest can you make no use of your discontent to the death my lord here man i am at thy elbow i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale is it possible that any villany should be so dear i wonder at it yes it is apparel yes the fashion is the fashion no twas the vane on the house all this i see and i see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion and thought they margaret was hero masters masters masters a commodity in question i warrant you come well obey you i am a gentleman sir and my name is conrade marry sir we say we are none off coxcomb away you are an ass you are an assand when i have heard it what blessing brings it let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that i am subdued would the cook were of my mind shall we go prove whats to be done i will presently go learn their day of marriage if your leisure served i would speak with you to claudio  means your lordship to be married tomorrow i know not that when he knows what i know if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordinglyi came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage marry it is your brothers right hand even he marry on hero the daughter and heir of leonato being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself and having obtained her give her to count claudio well wait upon your lordship and that is claudio i know him by his bearing so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight yea my lord but i can cross it not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her ladys chamber window the poison of that lies in you to temper go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudiowhose estimation do you mightily hold upto a contaminated stale such a one as hero proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato look you for any other issue go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio asin love of your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maidthat you have discovered thus they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamberwindow hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended weddingfor in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absentand there shall appear such seeming truth of heros disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me what conrade conrade i say mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a scab follow stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard utter all to thee therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will that shows thou art unconfirmed thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man i mean the fashion tush i may as well say the fools the fool but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is didst thou not hear somebody seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this fashion is how giddily a turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and fiveandthirty sometimes fashioning them like pharaohs soldiers in the reeky painting sometime like god bels priests in the old churchwindow sometime like the shaven hercules in the smirched wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club not so neither but know that i have tonight wooed margaret the lady heros gentlewoman by the name of hero she leans me out at her mistress chamberwindow bids me a thousand times good nighti tell this tale vilelyi should first tell thee how the prince claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander that don john had made away went claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw oer night and send her home again without a husband we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these mens bills borachio yea sir we hope sir i say to you we are none master constable sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer do you hear me and let this count kill me i have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how don john your brother incensed me to slander the lady hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court margaret in heros garments how you disgraced her when you should marry her my villany they have upon record which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame the lady is dead upon mine and my masters false accusation and briefly i desire nothing but the reward of a villain yea and paid me richly for the practise of it if you would know your wronger look on me yea even i alone no by my soul she was not nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me but always hath been just and virtuous in any thing that i do know by herwell i would you did like me which is one i love you the better the hearers may cry amen amen no more words the clerk is answered o good my lord tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once because you talk of wooing i will sing since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes yet will he swear he loves note this before my notes theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting sigh no more ladies sigh no more men were deceivers ever one foot in sea and one on shore to one thing constant never then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny sing no more ditties sing no moe of dumps so dull and heavy the fraud of men was ever so since summer first was leafy then sigh not so   c and an ill singer my lord the best i can my lordso would not i for your own sake for i have many illqualities i say my prayers aloud god match me with a good dancer and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done answer clerk ill make her come i warrant you presently troth i think your other rabato were better by my troth s not so good and i warrant your cousin will say so i like the new tire within excellently if the hair were a thought browner and your gowns a most rare fashion i faith i saw the duchess of milans gown that they praise so by my troth s but a nightgown in respect of yours cloth o gold and cuts and laced with silver set with pearls down sleeves side sleeves and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel but for a fine quaint graceful and excellent fashion yours is worth ten on t twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man of what lady of speaking honourably is not marriage honourable in a beggar is not your lord honourable without marriage i think you would have me say saving your reverence a husband and bad thinking do not wrest true speaking ill offend nobody is there any harm in the heavier for a husband none i think and it be the right husband and the right wife otherwise tis light and not heavy ask my lady beatrice else here she comes claps into light o love that goes without a burden do you sing it and ill dance it o illegitimate construction i scorn that with my heels for a hawk a horse or a husband well and you be not turned turk theres no more sailing by the star nothing i but god send every one their hearts desire a maid and stuffed theres goodly catching of cold even since you left it doth not my wit become me rarely get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus and lay it to your heart it is the only thing for a qualm moral no by my troth i have no moral meaning i meant plain holythistle you may think perchance that i think you are in love nay byr lady i am not such a fool to think what i list nor i list not to think what i can nor indeed i cannot think if i would think my heart out of thinking that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love yet benedick was such another and now is he become a man he swore he would never marry and yet now in despite of his heart he eats his meat without grudging and how you may be converted i know not but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do not a false gallop will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty to have no man come over me why shall i always keep below stairs and yours as blunt as the fencers foils which hit but hurt not give us the swords we have bucklers of our own well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legsi know you well enough you are signior antonio i know you by the waggling of your head you could never do him so illwell unless you were the very man heres his dry hand up and down you are he you are he come come do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit can virtue hide itself go to mum you are he graces will appear and theres an end the pleasantst angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture fear you not my part of the dialogue but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely and did they bid you tell her of it madam why did you so doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest she make sport at it sure sure such carping is not commendable yet tell her of it hear what she will say o do not do your cousin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true judgment having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to haveas to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy his excellence did earn it ere he had it when are you married madam shes limed i warrant you we have caught her madam i will lady well madam withdraw the prince the count signior benedick don john and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church madam you must come to your uncle yonders old coil at home it is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused the prince and claudio mightily abused and don john is the author of all who is fed and gone will you come presentlysignior i am here already sirare you good men and true nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the princes watch first who think you the most desertless man to be constable come hither neighbour seacole god hath blessed you with a good name to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature you have i knew it would be your answer well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the princes name why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave true and they are to meddle with none but the princes subjects you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats this is the end of the chargeyou constable are to present the princes own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will ha ha ha well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows counsels and your own and good night come neighbour one word more honest neighbours i

not hear us well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the churchbench till two and then all to bed aside  peace stir not aside  some treason masters yet stand close aside  i know that deformed a has been a vile thief this seven year a goes up and down like a gentleman i remember his name youll be made bring deformed forth i warrant you and that count claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace hero before the whole assembly and not marry her this is allhow if a will not stand call up the right master constable we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth marry that he had received a thousand ducats of don john for accusing the lady hero wrongfullyyou come hither my lord to marry this lady lady you come hither to be married to this count hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune  by noting of the lady i have markd a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes and in her eye there hath appeard a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observations which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenor of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error there is some strange misprision in the princes pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your familys old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must so be maintaind upon the instant that she was accused shall be lamented pitied and excused of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparelld in more precious habit more movingdelicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levelld false the supposition of the ladys death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries to do what signior and my help here comes the prince and claudio all this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended ill tell you largely of fair heros death meantime let wonder seem familiar and to the chapel let us presentlyif either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined charge you on your souls to utter it know you any count have comfort lady yea wherefore should she not lady what man is he you are accused of tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure come lady die to live this weddingday perhaps is but prolongd have patience and endure did i not tell you she was innocentwhich be the malefactors but which are the offenders that are to be examined let them come before master constable master constable you go not the way to examine you must call forth the watch that are their accusers what heard you him say else what else fellow what else and this is more masters than you can deny prince john is this morning secretly stolen away hero was in this manner accused in this very manner refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died master constable let these men be bound and brought to leonatos i will go before and show him their examinationit is my lord
