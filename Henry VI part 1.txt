rehearse the method of my pen no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks as very infants prattle of thy pride thou art a most pernicious usurer forward by nature enemy to peace lascivious wanton more than well beseems a man of thy profession and degree and for thy treachery whats more manifest in that thou laidst a trap to take my life as well at london bridge as at the tower beside i fear me if thy thoughts were sifted the king thy sovereign is not quite exempt from envious malice of thy swelling heart bishop as good thou bastard of my grandfather bishop am i not protector saucy priest bishop yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps and useth it to patronage his theft bishop thou art reverent touching thy spiritual function not thy life bishop you of my household leave this peevish broil and set this unaccustomd fight aside third servingmanmy lord we know your grace to be a man just and upright and for your royal birth inferior to none but to his majesty and ere that we will suffer such a prince so kind a father of the commonweal to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate we and our wives and children all will fight and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes first servingmanay and the very parings of our nails shall pitch a field when we are dead stay stay i say and if you love me as you say you do let me persuade you to forbear awhile compassion on the king commands me stoop or i would see his heart out ere the priest should ever get that privilege of me here winchester i offer thee my hand aside  ay but i fear me with a hollow heart see here my friends and loving countrymen this token serveth for a flag of truce betwixt ourselves and all our followers so help me god as i dissemble not bishop well urged my lord of warwick or sweet prince and if your grace mark every circumstance you have great reason to do richard right especially for those occasions at eltham place i told your majesty now will it best avail your majesty to cross the seas and to be crownd in france the presence of a king engenders love amongst his subjects and his loyal friends as it disanimates his enemies your ships already are in readiness yes if it please your majesty my liege lord bishop set the crown upon his head bishop now governor of paris take your oath that you elect no other king but him esteem none friends but such as are his friends and none your foes but such as shall pretend malicious practises against his state this shall ye do so help you righteous god to say the truth this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man much more a knight a captain and a leader what means his grace that he hath changed his style no more but plain and bluntly to the king hath he forgot he is his sovereign or doth this churlish superscription pretend some alteration in good will whats here   i have upon especial cause moved with compassion of my countrys wreck together with the pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon forsaken your pernicious faction and joind with charles the rightful king of france o monstrous treachery can this be so that in alliance amity and oaths there should be found such false dissembling guile he doth my lord and is become your foe it is the worst and all my lord he writes confirm it so confounded be your strife and perish ye with your audacious prate presumptuous vassals are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us and you my lords methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course i have my lord and their intent is this they humbly sue unto your excellence to have a godly peace concluded of between the realms of england and of france well my good lord and as the only means to stop effusion of our christian blood and stablish quietness on every side beside my lord the sooner to effect and surer bind this knot of amity the earl of armagnac near knit to charles a man of great authority in france proffers his only daughter to your grace in marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry and for the proffer of my lord your master i have informd his highness so at large as liking of the ladys virtuous gifts her beauty and the value of her dower he doth intend she shall be englands queen so should i give consent to flatter sin you know my lord your highness is betrothd unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach why what i pray is margaret more than that her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles ay grief i fear me both at first and lastwe mourn in black why mourn we not in blood henry is dead and never shall revive upon a wooden coffin we attend and deaths dishonourable victory we with our stately presence glorify like captives bound to a triumphant car what shall we curse the planets of mishap that plotted thus our glorys overthrow or shall we think the subtlewitted french conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him by magic verses have contrived his end bishop how were they lost what treachery was used were our tears wanting to this funeral these tidings would call forth their flowing tides the dauphin crowned king all fly to him o whither shall we fly from this reproach remember lords your oaths to henry sworn either to quell the dauphin utterly or bring him in obedience to your yoke to eltham will i where the young king is being ordaind his special governor and for his safety there ill best devise   bishop ay we may march in england or in france not seeing what is likely to ensue this late dissension grown betwixt the peers burns under feigned ashes of forged love and will at last break out into a flame as festerd members rot but by degree till bones and flesh and sinews fall away so will this base and envious discord breed and now i fear that fatal prophecy which in the time of henry named the fifth was in the mouth of every sucking babe that henry born at monmouth should win all and henry born at windsor lose all which is so plain that exeter doth wish his days may finish ere that hapless time it grieves his highness good my lords be friends well didst thou richard to suppress thy voice for had the passions of thy heart burst out i fear we should have seen decipherd there more rancorous spite more furious raging broils than yet can be imagined or supposed but howsoeer no simple man that sees this jarring discord of nobility this shouldering of each other in the court this factious bandying of their favourites but that it doth presage some ill event tis much when sceptres are in childrens hands but more when envy breeds unkind division there comes the rain there begins confusion what is my lord of winchester installd and calld unto a cardinals degree then i perceive that will be verified henry the fifth did sometime prophesy if once he come to be a cardinal hell make his cap coequal with the crown beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than givehe was a king blessd of the king of kings unto the french the dreadful judgementday so dreadful will not be as was his sight the battles of the lord of hosts he fought the churchs prayers made him so prosperous each hath his place and function to attend i am left out for me nothing remains but long i will not be jack out of office the king from eltham i intend to steal and sit at chiefest stern of public weal how now ambitious humphry what means this i do thou most usurping proditor and not protector of the king or realm nay stand thou back i will not budge a foot this be damascus be thou cursed cain to slay thy brother abel if thou wilt heres gloucester a foe to citizens one that still motions war and never peace oercharging your free purses with large fines that seeks to overthrow religion because he is protector of the realm and would have armour here out of the tower to crown himself king and suppress the prince comest thou with deep premeditated lines with written pamphlets studiously devised humphrey of gloucester if thou canst accuse or aught intendst to lay unto my charge do it without invention suddenly as i with sudden and extemporal speech purpose to answer what thou canst object ay lordly sir for what are you i pray but one imperious in anothers throne unreverent gloster well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee love for thy love and hand for hand i give god save king henry of that name the sixth stay my lord legate you shall first receive the sum of money which i promised should be deliverd to his holiness for clothing me in these grave ornaments lord regent i do greet your excellence with letters of commission from the king for know my lords the states of christendom moved with remorse of these outrageous broils have earnestly implored a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth to confer about some matter charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute submit thyself thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him and still enjoy thy regal dignitygloucester whateer we like thou art protector and lookest to command the prince and realm thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe more than god or religious churchmen may what wherein talbot overcame ist so do what thou darest i beard thee to thy face gloucester thou wilt answer this before the pope gloucester we will meet to thy cost be sure thy heartblood i will have for this days work abominable gloucester guard thy head for i intend to have it ere long gloucester i do defy thee lords vouchsafe to give me hearing what i shall reply if i were covetous ambitious or perverse as he will have me how am i so poor or how haps it i seek not to advance or raise myself but keep my wonted calling and for dissension who preferreth peace more than i doexcept i be provoked no my good lords it is not that offends it is not that that hath incensed the duke it is because no one should sway but he no one but he should be about the king and that engenders thunder in his breast and makes him roar these accusations forth but he shall know i am as good and am not i a prelate of the church rome shall remedy this he shall submit or i will never yield aside  so help me god as i intend it not as will the rest so willeth winchester aside  now winchester will not submit i trow or be inferior to the proudest peer humphrey of gloucester thou shalt well perceive that neither in birth or for authority the bishop will be overborne by thee ill either make thee stoop and bend thy knee or sack this country with a mutinymy honourable lords health to you all sad tidings bring i to you out of france of loss of slaughter and discomfiture guienne champagne rheims orleans paris guysors poictiers are all quite lost no treachery but want of men and money amongst the soldiers this is muttered that here you maintain several factions and whilst a field should be dispatchd and fought you are disputing of your generals one would have lingering wars with little cost another would fly swift but wanteth wings a third thinks without expense at all by guileful fair words peace may be obtaind awake awake english nobility let not sloth dim your horrors newbegot croppd are the flowerdeluces in your arms of englands coat one half is cut away lords view these letters full of bad mischance france is revolted from the english quite except some petty towns of no import the dauphin charles is crowned king of rheims the bastard of orleans with him is joind reignier duke of anjou doth take his part the duke of alencon flieth to his side my gracious lords to add to your laments wherewith you now bedew king henrys hearse i must inform you of a dismal fight betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french bishop o no wherein lord talbot was oerthrown the circumstance ill tell you more at large the tenth of august last this dreadful lord retiring from the siege of orleans having full scarce six thousand in his troop by three and twenty thousand of the french was round encompassed and set upon no leisure had he to enrank his men he wanted pikes to set before his archers instead whereof sharp stakes pluckd out of hedges they pitched in the ground confusedly to keep the horsemen off from breaking in more than three hours the fight continued where valiant talbot above human thought enacted wonders with his sword and lance hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him here there and every where enraged he flew the french exclaimd the devil was in arms all the whole army stood agazed on him his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit a talbot a talbot cried out amain and rushd into the bowels of the battle here had the conquest fully been seald up if sir john fastolfe had not playd the coward he being in the vaward placed behind with purpose to relieve and follow them cowardly fled not having struck one stroke hence grew the general wreck and massacre enclosed were they with their enemies a base walloon to win the dauphins grace thrust talbot with a spear into the back whom all france with their chief assembled strength durst not presume to look once in the face o no he lives but is took prisoner and lord scales with him and lord hungerford most of the rest slaughterd or took likewise so you had need for orleans is besieged the english army is grown weak and faint the earl of salisbury craveth supply and hardly keeps his men from mutiny since they so few watch such a multitude my lord my lord the french have gathered head the dauphin with one joan la pucelle joind a holy prophetess new risen up is come with a great power to raise the siege all hail my lords which of this princely train call ye the warlike talbot for his acts so much applauded through the realm of france the virtuous lady countess of auvergne with modesty admiring thy renown by me entreats great lord

message craved so is lord talbot come countess madam it is countess stay my lord talbot for my lady craves to know the cause of your abrupt departure they are returnd my lord and give it out that he is marchd to bourdeaux with his power to fight with talbot as he marchd along by your espials were discovered two mightier troops than that the dauphin led which joind with him and made their march for bourdeauxmars his true moving even as in the heavens so in the earth to this day is not known late did he shine upon the english side now we are victors upon us he smiles what towns of any moment but we have at pleasure here we lie near orleans otherwhiles the famishd english like pale ghosts faintly besiege us one hour in a month sound sound alarum we will rush on them now for the honour of the forlorn french him i forgive my death that killeth me when he sees me go back one foot or fly who ever saw the like what men have i dogs cowards dastards i would neer have fled but that they left me midst my enemies lets leave this town for they are harebraind slaves and hunger will enforce them to be more eager of old i know them rather with their teeth the walls theyll tear down than forsake the siege bastard of orleans thrice welcome to us go call her in   but first to try her skill reignier stand thou as dauphin in my place question her proudly let thy looks be stern by this means shall we sound what skill she hath thou hast astonishd me with thy high terms only this proof ill of thy valour make in single combat thou shalt buckle with me and if thou vanquishest thy words are true otherwise i renounce all confidence then come o gods name i fear no woman stay stay thy hands thou art an amazon and fightest with the sword of deborah whoeer helps thee tis thou that must help me impatiently i burn with thy desire my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued excellent pucelle if thy name be so let me thy servant and not sovereign be tis the french dauphin sueth to thee thus meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall what she says ill confirm well fight it out was mahomet inspired with a dove thou with an eagle art inspired then helen the mother of great constantine nor yet saint philips daughters were like thee bright star of venus falln down on the earth how may i reverently worship thee enough presently well try come lets away about it no prophet will i trust

thy glorious prophetess recoverd is the town of orleans more blessed hap did neer befall our state tis joan not we by whom the day is won for which i will divide my crown with her and all the priests and friars in my realm shall in procession sing her endless praise a statelier pyramis to her ill rear than rhodopes or memphis ever was in memory of her when she is dead her ashes in an urn more precious than the richjeweld of darius transported shall be at high festivals before the kings and queens of france no longer on saint denis will we cry but joan la pucelle shall be frances saint come in and let us banquet royally after this golden day of victory is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame didst thou at first to flatter us withal make us partakers of a little gain that now our loss might be ten times so much duke of alencon this was your default that being captain of the watch tonight did look no better to that weighty charge and for myself most part of all this night within her quarter and mine own precinct i was employd in passing to and fro about relieving of the sentinels then how or which way should they first break in saint denis bless this happy stratagem and once again well sleep secure in rouen now shine it like a comet of revenge a prophet to the fall of all our foes your grace may starve perhaps before that time we have been guided by thee hitherto and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust ay marry sweeting if we could do that france were no place for henrys warriors nor should that nation boast it so with us but be extirped from our provinces a parley with the duke of burgundy speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words welcome brave duke thy friendship makes us fresh now let us on my lords and join our powers and seek how we may prejudice the foe had york and somerset brought rescue in we should have found a bloody day of this o no forbear for that which we have fled during the life let us not wrong it dead on what submissive message art thou sent for prisoners askst thou hell our prison is but tell me whom thou seekst go take their bodies hence so we be rid of them do with em what thou wilt and now to paris in this conquering vein all will be ours now bloody talbots slain these news my lord may cheer our drooping spirits tis said the stout parisians do revolt and turn again unto the warlike french what tidings send our scouts i prithee speak somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is but we will presently provide for them then on my lords and france be fortunate since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaimd in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be tis known already that i am possessd with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquishd detract so much from that prerogative as to be calld but viceroy of the whole no lord ambassador ill rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all it shall only reserved you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrisonthey want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves either they must be dieted like mules and have their provender tied to their mouths or piteous they will look like drowned mice froissart a countryman of ours records england all olivers and rowlands bred during the time edward the third did reign more truly now may this be verified for none but samsons and goliases it sendeth forth to skirmish one to ten lean rawboned rascals who would eer suppose they had such courage and audacity be it so doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock else neer could he so long protract his speech he may mean more than we poor men do know these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues leave off delays and let us raise the siege all france will be replete with mirth and joy when they shall hear how we have playd the men how now my lords what all unready so of all exploits since first i followd arms neer heard i of a warlike enterprise more venturous or desperate than this here cometh charles i marvel how he sped had all your quarters been as safely kept as that whereof i had the government we had not been thus shamefully surprised signior no well set thy statue in some holy place and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint employ thee then sweet virgin for our good for ever should they be expulsed from france and not have title of an earldom here pucelle hath bravely playd her part in this and doth deserve a coronet of gold then march to paris royal charles of france and keep not back your powers in dalliance must he be then as shadow of himself adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man this proffer is absurd and reasonless to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serveslets raise the siege why live we idly here talbot is taken whom we wont to fear remaineth none but madbraind salisbury and he may well in fretting spend his gall nor men nor money hath he to make war salisbury is a desperate homicide he fighteth as one weary of his life the other lords like lions wanting food do rush upon us as their hungry prey i think by some odd gimmors or device their arms are set like clocks stiff to strike on else neer could they hold out so as they do by my consent well even let them alone fair maid ist thou wilt do these wondrous feats she takes upon her bravely at first dash my lord methinks is very long in talk shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean my lord where are you what devise you on shall we give over orleans or no woman do what thou canst to save our honours drive them from orleans and be immortalized why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town dauphin command the citizens make bonfires and feast and banquet in the open streets to celebrate the joy that god hath given us twas time i trow to wake and leave our beds hearing alarums at our chamberdoors if not of hell the heavens sure favour him and so was mine my lord by thrusting out a torch from yonder tower which once discernd shows that her meaning is no way to that for weakness which she enterd defer no time delays have dangerous ends enter and cry the dauphin presently and then do execution on the watch to whom suffolk what remedy i am a soldier and unapt to weep or to exclaim on fortunes fickleness speaks suffolk as he thinks upon thy princely warrant i descend to give thee answer of thy just demand welcome brave earl into our territories command in anjou what your honour pleases since thou dost deign to woo her little worth to be the princely bride of such a lord upon condition i may quietly enjoy mine own the country maine and anjou free from oppression or the stroke of war my daughter shall be henrys if he please and i again in henrys royal name as deputy unto that gracious king give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith i do embrace thee as i would embrace the christian prince king henry were he here my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunitywheres the prince dauphin i have news for him methinks your looks are sad your cheer appalld hath the late overthrow wrought this offence be not dismayd for succor is at hand a holy maid hither with me i bring which by a vision sent to her from heaven ordained is to raise this tedious siege and drive the english forth the bounds of france the spirit of deep prophecy she hath exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome whats past and whats to come she can descry speak shall i call her in believe my words for they are certain and unfallible unready ay and glad we scaped so well i think this talbot be a fiend of hell tut holy joan was his defensive guard mine was secure here enterd pucelle and her practisants now she is there how will she specify where is the best and safest passage in see noble charles the beacon of our friend the burning torch in yonder turret stands search out thy wit for secret policies and we will make thee famous through the world and doth beget new courage in our breasts how the young whelp of talbots ragingwood did flesh his puny sword in frenchmens blood hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder whose life was englands glory gallias wonderreignier ist thou that thinkest to beguile me where is the dauphin come come from behind i know thee well though never seen before be not amazed theres nothing hid from me in private will i talk with thee apart stand back you lords and give us leave awhile dauphin i am by birth a shepherds daughter my wit untraind in any kind of art heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased to shine on my contemptible estate lo whilst i waited on my tender lambs and to suns parching heat displayd my cheeks gods mother deigned to appear to me and in a vision full of majesty willd me to leave my base vocation and free my country from calamity her aid she promised and assured success in complete glory she reveald herself and whereas i was black and swart before with those clear rays which she infused on me that beauty am i blessd with which you see ask me what question thou canst possible and i will answer unpremeditated my courage try by combat if thou darest and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate if thou receive me for thy warlike mate i am prepared here is my keenedged sword deckd with five flowerdeluces on each side the which at touraine in saint katharines churchyard out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth and while i live ill neer fly from a man christs mother helps me else i were too weak i must not yield to any rites of love for my professions sacred from above when i have chased all thy foes from hence then will i think upon a recompense why no i say distrustful recreants fight till the last gasp i will be your guard assignd am i to be the english scourge this night the siege assuredly ill raise expect saint martins summer halcyon days since i have entered into these wars glory is like a circle in the water which never ceaseth to enlarge itself till by broad spreading it disperse to nought with henrys death the english circle ends dispersed are the glories it included now am i like that proud insulting ship which caesar and his fortune bare at once come come tis only i that must disgrace thee wherefore is charles impatient with his friend at all times will you have my power alike sleeping or waking must i still prevail or will you blame and lay the fault on me improvident soldiers had your watch been good this sudden mischief never could have falln these are the city gates the gates of rouen through which our policy must make a breach take heed be wary how you place your words talk like the vulgar sort of market men that come to gather money for their corn if we have entrance as i hope we shall and that we find the slothful watch but weak ill by a sign give notice to our friends that charles the dauphin may encounter them now rouen ill shake thy bulwarks to the ground behold this is the happy wedding torch that joineth rouen unto her countrymen but burning fatal to the talbotites what will you do good greybeard break a lance and run a tilt at death within a chair are ye so hot sir yet pucelle hold thy peace if talbot do but thunder rain will follow   god speed the parliament who shall be the speaker belike your lordship takes us then for fools to try if that our own be ours or no away captains lets get us from the walls for talbot means no goodness by his looks god be wi you my lord we came but to tell you that we are here then thus it must be this doth joan devise by fair persuasions mixd with sugard words we will entice the duke of burgundy to leave the talbot and to follow us your honours shall perceive how i will work to bring this matter to the wished end   hark by the sound of drum you may perceive their powers are marching unto parisward   there goes the talbot with his colours spread and all the troops of english after him   now in the rearward comes the duke and his fortune in favour makes him lag behind summon a parley we will talk with him the princely charles of france thy countryman brave burgundy undoubted hope of france stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee look on thy country look on fertile france and see the cities and the towns defaced by wasting ruin of the cruel foe as looks the mother on her lowly babe when death doth close his tender dying eyes see see the pining malady of france behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds which thou thyself hast given her woful breast o turn thy edged sword another way strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help one drop of blood drawn from thy countrys bosom should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore return thee therefore with a flood of tears and wash away thy countrys stained spots besides all french and france exclaims on thee doubting thy birth and lawful progeny who jointst thou with but with a lordly nation that will not trust thee but for profits sake when talbot hath set footing once in france and fashiond thee that instrument of ill who then but english henry will be lord and thou be thrust out like a fugitive call we to mind and mark but this for proof was not the duke of orleans thy foe and was he not in england prisoner but when they heard he was thine enemy they set him free without his ransom paid in spite of burgundy and all his friends see then thou fightst against thy countrymen and jointst with them will be thy slaughtermen come come return return thou wandering lord charles and the rest will take thee in their arms aside  done like a frenchman turn and turn again once i encounterd him and thus i said thou maiden youth be vanquishd by a maid but with a proud majestical high scorn he answerd thus young talbot was not born to be the pillage of a giglot wench so rushing in the bowels of the french he left me proudly as unworthy fight here is a silly stately style indeed the turk that two and fifty kingdoms

proud commanding spirit for gods sake let him have em to keep them here they would but stink and putrefy the air peace be amongst them if they turn to us else ruin combat with their palaces of all

marketplace produced they me to be a public spectacle to all here said they is the terror of the french the scarecrow that affrights our children so then broke i from the officers that led me and with my nails diggd stones out of the ground to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly none durst come near for fear of sudden death in iron walls they deemd me not secure so great fear of my name mongst them was spread that they supposed i could rend bars of steel and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had that walked about me every

hath crossd us speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak how farest thou mirror of all martial men one of thy eyes and thy cheeks side struck off accursed tower accursed fatal hand that hath contrived this woful tragedy in thirteen battles salisbury oercame henry the fifth he first traind to the wars whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up his sword did neer leave striking in the

spirits god is our fortress in whose conquering name let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks not all together better far i guess that we do make our entrance several ways that if it chance the one of us do fail the other yet may rise against their force and here will talbot mount or make his grave now salisbury for thee and for the right of english henry shall this night appear how much in duty i am bound to both bring forth the body of old salisbury and here advance it in the marketplace the middle centre of this cursed town now have i paid my vow unto his soul for every drop of blood was drawn from him there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happend in revenge of him within their chiefest temple ill erect a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interrd upon the which that every one may read shall be engraved the sack of orleans the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france but lords in all our bloody massacre i muse we met not with the dauphins grace his newcome champion virtuous joan of arc nor any of his false confederates here is the talbot who would speak with him neer trust me

substance is not here for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity i tell you madam were the whole frame here it is of such a spacious lofty pitch your roof were not sufficient to containt countess that will i show you presently   how say you madam are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself these are his substance sinews arms and strength with which he yoketh your rebellious necks razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate countess be not dismayd fair lady nor misconstrue the mind of talbot as you did mistake the outward composition of his body what you have done hath not offended me nor other satisfaction do i crave but only with your patience that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have for soldiers stomachs always serve them well countess france thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears if talbot but survive thy treachery pucelle that witch that damned sorceress hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares that hardly we escaped the pride of france foul fiend of france and hag of all despite encompassd with thy lustful paramours becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age and twit with cowardice a man half dead damsel ill have a bout with you again or else let talbot perish with this shame dare ye come forth and meet us in the field i speak not to that railing hecate but unto thee alencon and the rest will ye like soldiers come and fight it out signior hang base muleters of france like peasant footboys do they keep the walls and dare not take up arms like gentlemen and there will we be too ere it be long or else reproach be talbots greatest fame vow burgundy by honour of thy house prickd on by public wrongs sustaind in france either to get the town again or die and i as sure as english henry lives and as his father here was conqueror as sure as in this latebetrayed town great coeurdelions heart was buried so sure i swear to get the town or die but ere we go regard this dying prince the valiant duke of bedford come my lord we will bestow you in some better place fitter for sickness and for crazy age undaunted spirit in a dying breast then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe and now no more ado brave burgundy but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy lost and recoverd in a day again this is a double honour burgundy yet heavens have glory for this victory thanks gentle duke but where is pucelle now i think her old familiar is asleep now wheres the bastards braves and charles his gleeks what all amort rouen hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled now will we take some order in the town placing therein some expert officers and then depart to paris to the king for there young henry with his nobles lie but yet before we go lets not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceased but see his exequies fulfilld in rouen a braver soldier never couched lance a gentler heart did never sway in court but kings and mightiest potentates must die for thats the end of human misery my gracious prince and honourable peers hearing of your arrival in this realm i have awhile given truce unto my wars to do my duty to my sovereign in sign whereof this arm that hath reclaimd to your obedience fifty fortresses twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength beside five hundred prisoners of esteem lets fall his sword before your highness feet and with submissive loyalty of heart ascribes the glory of his conquest got first to my god and next unto your grace shame to the duke of burgundy and thee i vowd base knight when i did meet thee next to tear the garter from thy cravens leg   which i have done because unworthily thou wast installed in that high degree pardon me princely henry and the rest this dastard at the battle of patay when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one before we met or that a stroke was given like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men myself and divers gentlemen beside were there surprised and taken prisoners then judge great lords if i have done amiss or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood yea or no when first this order was ordaind my lords knights of the garter were of noble birth valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes he then that is not furnishd in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight profaning this most honourable order and should if i were worthy to be judge be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood content my liege yes but that i am prevented i should have beggd i might have been employd i go my lord in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes go to the gates of bourdeaux trumpeter summon their general unto the wall   english john talbot captains calls you forth servant in arms to harry king of england and thus he would open your city gates be humble to us call my sovereign yours and do him homage as obedient subjects and ill withdraw me and my bloody power but if you frown upon this profferd peace you tempt the fury of my three attendants lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire who in a moment even with the earth shall lay your stately and airbraving towers if you forsake the offer of their love he fables not i hear the enemy out some light horsemen and peruse their wings o negligent and heedless discipline how are we parkd and bounded in a pale a little herd of englands timorous deer mazed with a yelping kennel of french curs if we be english deer be then in blood not rascallike

shall find dear deer of us my friends god and saint george talbot and englands right prosper our colours in this dangerous fight o young john talbot i did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war that talbots name might be in thee revived when sapless age and weak unable limbs should bring thy father to his drooping chair but o malignant and illboding stars now thou art come unto a feast of death a terrible and unavoided danger therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse and ill direct thee how thou shalt escape by sudden flight come dally not be gone fly to revenge my death if i be slain if we both stay we both are sure to die shall all thy mothers hopes lie in one tomb upon my blessing i command thee go part of thy father may be saved in thee thou never hadst renown nor canst

eclipse thy life this afternoon come side by side together live and die and soul with soul from france to heaven fly saint george and victory fight soldiers fight the regent hath with talbot broke his word and left us to the rage of france his sword where is john talbot pause and take thy breath i gave thee life and rescued thee from death when from the dauphins crest thy sword struck fire it warmd thy fathers heart with proud desire of boldfaced victory then leaden age quickend with youthful spleen and warlike rage beat down alencon orleans burgundy and from the pride of gallia rescued thee the ireful bastard orleans that drew blood from thee my boy and had the maidenhood of thy first fight i soon encountered and interchanging blows i quickly shed some of his bastard blood and in disgrace bespoke him thus contaminated base and misbegotten blood i spill of thine mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine which thou didst force from talbot my brave boy here purposing the bastard to destroy came in strong rescue speak thy fathers care art thou not weary john how dost thou fare wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly now thou art seald the son of chivalry fly to revenge my death when i am dead the help of one stands me in little stead o too much folly is it well i wot to hazard all our lives in one small boat if i today die not with frenchmens rage tomorrow i shall die with mickle age by me they nothing gain an if i stay tis but the shortening of my life one day in thee thy mother dies our households name my deaths revenge thy youth and englands fame all these and more we hazard by thy stay all these are saved if thou wilt fly away then follow thou thy desperate sire of crete thou icarus thy life to me is sweet if thou wilt fight fight by thy fathers side and commendable proved lets die in pride where is my other life mine own is gone o wheres young talbot where is valiant john triumphant death smeard with captivity young talbots valour makes me smile at thee when he perceived me shrink and on my knee his bloody sword he brandishd over me and like a hungry lion did commence rough deeds of rage and stern impatience but when my angry guardant stood alone tendering my ruin and assaild of none dizzyeyed fury and great rage of heart suddenly made him from my side to start into the clustering battle of the french and in that sea of blood my boy did drench his overmounting spirit and there died my icarus my blossom in his pride thou antic death which laughst us here to scorn anon from thy insulting tyranny coupled in bonds of perpetuity two talbots winged through the lither sky in thy despite shall scape mortality o thou whose wounds become hardfavourd death speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath brave death by speaking whether he will or no imagine him a frenchman and thy foe poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say had death been french then death had died today come come and lay him in his fathers arms my spirit can no longer bear these harms soldiers adieu i have what i would have now my old arms are young john talbots gravei think at the north gate for there stand lords o lord have mercy on me woful manand i here at the bulwark of the bridgetalbot farewell thy hour is not yet come i must go victual orleans forthwith   oertake me if thou canst i scorn thy strength go go cheer up thy hungrystarved men help salisbury to make his testament this day is ours as many more shall be advance our waving colours on the walls rescued is orleans from the english thus joan la pucelle hath performd her word dismay not princes at this accident nor grieve that rouen is so recovered care is no cure but rather corrosive for things that are not to be remedied let frantic talbot triumph for a while and like a peacock sweep along his tail well pull his plumes and take away his train if dauphin and the rest will be but ruledsirs take your places and be vigilant if any noise or soldier you perceive near to the walls by some apparent sign let us have knowledge at the court of guardsergeant you shall   thus are poor servitors when others sleep upon their quiet beds constraind to watch in darkness rain and coldtraitors have never other company but whats that pucelle whom they term so pure pray god she prove not masculine ere long if underneath the standard of the french she carry armour as she hath begun and i to this myself as far as i could well discern for smoke and dusky vapours of the night am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull when arm in arm they both came swiftly running like to a pair of loving turtledoves that could not live asunder day or night after that things are set in order here well follow them with all the power we have is it even so nay then i see our wars will turn unto a peaceful comic sport when ladies crave to be encounterd with you may not my lord despise her gentle suit scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan i trust ere long to choke thee with thine own and make thee curse the harvest of that corn my vows are equal partners with thy vows courageous bedford let us now persuade you warlike and martial talbot burgundy enshrines thee in his heart and there erects thy noble deeds as valours monuments what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy who craves a parley with the burgundy what sayst thou charles for i am marching hence speak on but be not overtedious either she hath bewitchd me with her words or nature makes me suddenly relent i am vanquished these haughty words of hers have batterd me like roaring cannonshot and made me almost yield upon my knees forgive me country and sweet countrymen and lords accept this hearty kind embrace my forces and my power of men are yours so farewell talbot ill no longer trust thee doubtless he would have made a noble knight see where he lies inhearsed in the arms of the most bloody nurser of his harms i trust the ghost of talbot is not there now he is gone my lord you need not feararm arm the enemy doth make assaultquestion my lords no further of the case how or which way tis sure they found some place but weakly guarded where the breach was made and now there rests no other shift but this to gather our soldiers scatterd and dispersed and lay new platforms to endamage them paysans pauvres gens de france poor market folks that come to sell their corn good morrow gallants want ye corn for bread i think the duke of burgundy will fast before hell buy again at such a rate twas full of darnel do you like the tasteill be so bold to take what they have left the cry of talbot serves me for a sword for i have loaden me with many spoils using no other weapon but his name our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city and we be lords and rulers over rouen therefore well knocki do my lord and mean accordingly whither away sir john fastolfe in such haste what will you fly and leave lord talbot cowardly knight ill fortune follow thee here is sir william lucy who with me set from our oermatchd forces forth for aidporter remember what i gave in charge and when you have done so bring the keys to me is this the scourge of france is this the talbot so much feard abroad that with his name the mothers still their babes i see report is fabulous and false i thought i should have seen some hercules a second hector for his grim aspect and large proportion of his strongknit limbs alas this is a child a silly dwarf it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp should strike such terror to his enemies what means he now go ask him whither he goes if thou be he then art thou prisoner to me bloodthirsty lord and for that cause i trained thee to my house long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me for in my gallery thy picture hangs but now the substance shall endure the like and i will chain these legs and arms of thine that hast by tyranny these many years wasted our country slain our citizens and sent our sons and husbands captivate laughest thou wretch thy mirth shall turn to moan why art not thou the man then have i substance too this is a riddling merchant for the nonce he will be here and yet he is not here how can these contrarieties agree victorious talbot pardon my abuse i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited and more than may be gatherd by thy shape let my presumption not provoke thy wrath for i am sorry that with reverence i did not entertain thee as thou art with all my heart and think me honoured to feast so great a warrior in my housemadam i will   countessthe plot is laid if all things fall out right i shall as famous be by this exploit as scythian tomyris by cyrus death great is the rumor of this dreadful knight and his achievements of no less account fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears to give their censure of these rare reports and he is welcome what is this the mangreat lords and gentlemen what means this silence dare no man answer in a case of truth then say at once if i maintaind the truth or else was wrangling somerset in the error tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts let him that is a trueborn gentleman and stands upon the honour of his birth if he suppose that i have pleaded truth from off this brier pluck a white rose with me and i now somerset where is your argument meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses for pale they look with fear as witnessing the truth on our side hath not thy rose a canker somerset ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood now by this maiden blossom in my hand i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee he bears him on the places privilege or durst not for his craven heart say thus my father was attached not attainted condemnd to die for treason but no traitor and that ill prove on better men than somerset were growing time once ripend to my will for your partaker pole and you yourself ill note you in my book of memory to scourge you for this apprehension look to it well and say you are well warnd and by my soul this pale and angry rose as cognizance of my blooddrinking hate will i for ever and my faction wear until it wither with me to my grave or flourish to the height of my degree how i am braved and must perforce endure it good master vernon i am bound to you that you on my behalf would pluck a flower thanks gentle sir come let us four to dinner i dare say this quarrel will drink blood another day ay noble uncle thus ignobly used your nephew late despised richard comes first lean thine aged back against mine arm and in that ease ill tell thee my disease this day in argument upon a case some words there grew twixt somerset and me among which terms he used his lavish tongue and did upbraid me with my fathers death which obloquy set bars before my tongue else with the like i had requited him therefore good uncle for my fathers sake in honour of a true plantagenet and for alliance sake declare the cause my father earl of cambridge lost his head discover more at large what cause that was for i am ignorant and cannot guess of which my lord your honour is the last thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet methinks my fathers execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny o uncle would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age and peace no war befall thy parting soul in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpassd thy days well i will lock his counsel in my breast and what i do imagine let that rest keepers convey him hence and i myself will see his burial better than his life   here dies the dusky torch of mortimer choked with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs those bitter injuries which somerset hath offerd to my house i doubt not but with honour to redress and therefore haste i to the parliament either to be restored to my blood or make my ill the advantage of my good aside  plantagenet i see must hold his tongue lest it be said speak sirrah when you should must your bold verdict enter talk with lords else would i have a fling at winchester thy humble servant vows obedience and humble service till the point of death and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall and as my duty springs so perish they that grudge one thought against your majestywithin the templehall we were too loud the garden here is more convenient richard faith i have been a truant in the law and never yet could frame my will to it and therefore frame the law unto my will i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet richard ill turn my part thereof into thy throat go forward and be choked with thy ambition and so farewell until i meet thee next be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner   o fairest beauty do not fear nor fly for i will touch thee but with reverent hands i kiss these fingers for eternal peace and lay them gently on thy tender side who art thou say that i may honour thee an earl i am and suffolk am i calld be not offended natures miracle thou art allotted to be taen by me so doth the swan her downy cygnets save keeping them prisoner underneath her wings yet if this servile usage once offend go and be free again as suffolks friend   o stay i have no power to let her pass my hand would free her but my heart says no as plays the sun upon the glassy streams twinkling another counterfeited beam so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak ill call for pen and ink and write my mind fie de la pole disable not thyself hast not a tongue is she not here wilt thou be daunted at a womans sight ay beautys princely majesty is such confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit before thou make a trial of her love shes beautiful and therefore to be wood she is a woman therefore to be won fond man remember that thou hast a wife then how can margaret be thy paramour there all is marrd there lies a cooling card and yet a dispensation may be had ill win this lady margaret for whom why for my king tush thats a wooden thing yet so my fancy may be satisfied and peace established between these realms but there remains a scruple in that too for though her father be the king of naples duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor and our nobility will scorn the match it shall be so disdain they neer so much henry is youthful and will quickly yield madam i have a secret to reveal lady vouchsafe to listen what i say sweet madam give me a hearing in a cause lady wherefore talk you so say gentle princess would you not suppose your bondage happy to be made a queen and so shall you if happy englands royal king be free ill undertake to make thee henrys queen to put a golden sceptre in thy hand and set a precious crown upon thy head if thou wilt condescend to be my his love no gentle madam i unworthy am to woo so fair a dame to be his wife and have no portion in the choice myself how say you madam are

king what answer makes your grace unto my suit that is her ransom i deliver her and those two counties i will undertake your grace shall well and quietly enjoy reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks because this is in traffic of a king   and yet methinks i could be well content to be mine own attorney in this case ill over then to england with this news and make this marriage to be solemnized so farewell reignier set this diamond safe in golden palaces as it becomes farewell sweet madam but hark you margaret no princely commendations to my king words sweetly placed and modestly directed but madam i must trouble you again no loving token to his majesty and this withal o wert thou for myself but suffolk stay thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk solicit henry with her wondrous praise bethink thee on her virtues that surmount and natural graces that extinguish art repeat their semblance often on the seas that when thou comest to kneel at henrys feet thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder tush my good lord this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so fullreplete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous chaste intents to love and honour henry as her lord as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vowd to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversarys odds a poor earls daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence yes lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and not seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferrd for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be linkd in love then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she thus suffolk hath prevaild and thus he goes as did the youthful paris once to greece with hope to find the like event in love but prosper better than the trojan did margaret shall now be queen and rule the king but i will rule both her the king and realmjudge you my lord of warwick then between us and on my side it is so well apparelld so clear so shining and so evident that it will glimmer through a blind mans eye richard let him that is no coward nor no flatterer but dare maintain the party of the truth pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me good master vernon it is well objected if i have fewest i subscribe in silence richard prick not your finger as you pluck it off lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red and fall on my side so against your will well well come on who else here

with a sally of the very town be buckled with the overdaring talbot hath sullied all his gloss of former honour by this unheedful desperate wild adventure york set him on to fight and die in shame that talbot dead great york might bear the name how now sir william whither were you sent york set him on york should have sent him aid york lies he might have sent and had the horse i owe him little duty and less love and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending come go i will dispatch the horsemen straight within six hours they will be at his aid if he be dead brave talbot then adieubetween two hawks which flies the higher pitch between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth between two blades which bears the better temper between two horses which doth bear him best between two girls which hath the merriest eye i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement but in these nice sharp quillets of the law good faith i am no wiser than a daw richard i love no colours and without all colour of base insinuating flattery i pluck this white rose with plantagenet now by gods will thou wrongst him somerset his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence third son to the third edward king of england spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root richard this blot that they object against your house shall be wiped out in the next parliament calld for the truce of winchester and gloucester and if thou be not then created york i will not live to be accounted warwick meantime in signal of my love to thee against proud somerset and william pole will i upon thy party wear this rose and here i prophesy this brawl today grown to this faction in the templegarden shall send between the red rose and the white a thousand souls to death and deadly night richard roam thither then ay see the bishop

and free be patient york if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby how sayst thou charles shall our condition standstay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more till you conclude that he upon whose side the fewest roses are croppd from the tree shall yield the other in the right opinion then for the truth and plainness of the case i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here giving my verdict on the white rose side if i my lord for my opinion bleed opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt and keep me on the side where still i am in your behalf still will i wear the same now sir to you that were so hot at sea disgracing of these colours that i wear in honour of my noble lord of york darest thou maintain the former words thou

sovereign with him my lord for he hath done me wrong and that is my petition noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent yet know my lord i was provoked by him and he first took exceptions at this badge pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewrayd the faintness of my masters heart nay let it rest where it began at firstunless my study and my books be false the argument you held was wrong in you   in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too richard and so will i richardkind keepers of my weak decaying age let dying mortimer here rest himself even like a man new haled from the rack so fare my limbs with long imprisonment and these grey locks the pursuivants of death nestorlike aged in an age of care argue the end of edmund mortimer these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent wax dim as drawing to their exigent weak shoulders overborne with burthening grief and pithless arms like to a witherd vine that droops his sapless branches to the ground yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb unable to support this lump of clay swiftwinged with desire to get a grave as witting i no other comfort have but tell me keeper will my nephew come enough my soul shall then be satisfied poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine since henry monmouth first began to reign before whose glory i was great in arms this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscured deprived of honour and inheritance but now the arbitrator of despairs just death kind umpire of mens miseries with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expired that so he might recover what was lost richard plantagenet my friend is he come richard direct mine arms i may embrace his neck and in his bosom spend my latter gasp o tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks that i may kindly give one fainting kiss and now declare sweet stem from yorks great stock why didst thou say of late thou wert despised richard that cause fair nephew that imprisond me and hath detaind me all my flowering youth within a loathsome dungeon there to pine was cursed instrument of his decease richard i will if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done henry the fourth grandfather to this king deposed his nephew richard edwards son the firstbegotten and the lawful heir of edward king the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north finding his usurpation most unjust endeavord my advancement to the throne the reason moved these warlike lords to this was for thatyoung king richard thus removed leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence the third son to king edward the third whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree being but fourth of that heroic line but mark as in this haughty attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir i lost my liberty and they their lives long after this when henry the fifth succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign thy father earl of cambridge then derived from famous edmund langley duke of york marrying my sister that thy mother was again in pity of my hard distress levied an army weening to redeem and have installd me in the diadem but as the rest so fell that noble earl and was beheaded thus the mortimers in whom the tide rested were suppressd richard true and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care richard with silence nephew be thou politic strongfixed is the house of lancaster and like a mountain not to be removed but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts when they are cloyd with long continuance in a settled place richard thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill mourn not except thou sorrow for my good only give order for my funeral and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war   richardrichard plantagenet my lord will come we sent unto the temple unto his chamber and answer was returnd that he will comemy lord your loving nephew now is comeuncles of gloucester and of winchester the special watchmen of our english weal i would prevail if prayers might prevail to join your hearts in love and amity o what a scandal is it to our crown that two such noble peers as ye should jar believe me lords my tender years can tell civil dissension is a viperous worm that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth   what tumults this we charge you on allegiance to ourself to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife first servingmannay if we be forbidden stones well fall to it with our teeth second servingmando what ye dare we are as resolute fie uncle beaufort i have heard you preach that malice was a great and grievous sin and will not you maintain the thing you teach but prove a chief offender in the same o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester how joyful am i made by this contract away my masters trouble us no more but join in friendship as your lords have done first servingmancontent ill to the surgeons second servingmanand so will i third servingmanand i will see what physic the tavern affords if richard will be true not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york from whence you spring by lineal descent richard stoop then and set your knee against my foot and in reguerdon of that duty done i gird thee with the valiant sword of york rise richard like a true plantagenet and rise created princely duke of york richard when gloucester says the word king henry goes for friendly counsel cuts off many foes is this the lord talbot uncle gloucester that hath so long been resident in france welcome brave captain and victorious lord when i was young as yet i am not old i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword long since we were resolved of your truth your faithful service and your toil in war yet never have you tasted our reward or been reguerdond with so much as thanks because till now we never saw your face therefore stand up and for these good deserts we here create you earl of shrewsbury and in our coronation take your place stain to thy countrymen thou hearst thy doom be packing therefore thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee on pain of death   and now my lord protector view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy is that the worst this letter doth contain why then lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse how say you my lord are you not content then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offence it is to flout his friends be patient lords and give them leave to speak say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim and wherefore crave you combat or with whom what is that wrong whereof you both complain first let me know and then ill answer you good lord what madness rules in brainsick men when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise good cousins both of york and somerset quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace come hither you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you as you love our favour quite to forget this quarrel and the cause and you my lords remember where we are in france amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to wilful disobedience and rebel beside what infamy will there arise when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy a thing of no regard king henrys peers and chief nobility destroyd themselves and lost the realm of france o think upon the conquest of my father my tender years and let us not forego that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife i see no reason if i wear this rose   that any one should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown because forsooth the king of scots is crownd but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore as we hither came in peace so let us still continue peace and love cousin of york we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france and good my lord of somerset unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot and like true subjects sons of your progenitors go cheerfully together and digest your angry choler on your enemies ourself my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to calais from thence to england where i hope ere long to be presented by your victories with charles alencon and that traitorous rout have you perused the letters from the pope the emperor and the earl of armagnac how doth your grace affect their motion ay marry uncle for i always thought it was both impious and unnatural that such immanity and bloody strife should reign among professors of one faith marriage uncle alas my years are young and fitter is my study and my books than wanton dalliance with a paramour yet call the ambassador and as you please so let them have their answers every one i shall be well content with any choice tends to gods glory and my countrys weal my lords ambassadors your several suits have been considerd and debated on and therefore are we certainly resolved to draw conditions of a friendly peace which by my lord of winchester we mean shall be transported presently to france in argument and proof of which contract bear her this jewel pledge of my affection and so my lord protector see them guarded and safely brought to dover where inshippd commit them to the fortune of the sea   cardinal your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonishd me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed loves settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assured i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crownd king henrys faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexed with a thousand cares and you good uncle banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my griefo how this discord doth afflict my soul can you my lord of winchester behold my sighs and tears and will not once relent who should be pitiful if you be not or who should study to prefer a peace if holy churchmen take delight in broilsand those occasions uncle were of force therefore my loving lords our pleasure is that richard be restored to his blood what doth my uncle burgundy revolt and otherwise will henry neer presume therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be englands royal queenwelcome high prince the mighty duke of yorkwithin  qui est la enter go in the market bell is rungwhither away to save myself by flight we are like to have the

upbraided me about the rose i wear saying the sanguine colour of the leaves did represent my masters blushing cheeks when stubbornly he did repugn the truth about a certain question in the law argued betwixt the duke of york and him with other vile and ignominious terms in confutation of which rude reproach and in defence of my lords worthiness i crave the benefit of law of arms confirm it so mine honourable lordthis is my servant hear him noble prince will not this malice somerset be left let this dissension first be tried by fight and then your highness shall command a peace there is my
