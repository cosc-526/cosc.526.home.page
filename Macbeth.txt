ingratitude even now was heavy on me thou art so far before that swiftest wing of recompense is slow to overtake thee would thou hadst less deserved that the proportion both of thanks and payment might have been mine only i have left to say more is thy due than more than all can pay welcome hither i have begun to plant thee and will labour to make thee full of growing noble banquo that hast no less deserved nor must be known no less to have done so let me enfold thee and hold thee to my heart my plenteous joys wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow sons kinsmen thanes and you whose places are the nearest know we will establish our estate upon our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter the prince of cumberland which honour must not unaccompanied invest him only but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine on all deservers from hence to inverness and bind us further to you my worthy cawdor true worthy banquo he is full so valiant and in his commendations i am fed it is a banquet to me lets after him whose care is gone before to bid us welcome it is a peerless kinsman this castle hath a pleasant seat the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses see see our honourd hostess the love that follows us sometime is our trouble which still we thank as love herein i teach you how you shall bid god ild us for your pains and thank us for your trouble wheres the thane of cawdor we coursed him at the heels and had a purpose to be his purveyor but he rides well and his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him to his home before us fair and noble hostess we are your guest tonight give me your hand conduct me to mine host we love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him by your leave hostessthis is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought gainst my captivity hail brave friend say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it the worthy thane of ross my liege they are not yet come back but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confessd his treasons implored your highness pardon and set forth a deep repentance nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as twere a careless trifle o by whom aside to donalbain  why do we hold our tongues that most may claim this argument for ours aside to donalbain        nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion what will you do lets not consort with them to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy ill to england this murderous shaft thats shot hath not yet lighted and our safest way is to avoid the aim therefore to horse and let us not be dainty of leavetaking but shift away theres warrant in that theft which steals itself when theres no mercy left let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty what i believe ill wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will what you have spoke it may be so perchance this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well he hath not touchd you yet i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god but macbeth is a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge but i shall crave your pardon that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose angels are bright still though the brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so perchance even there where i did find my doubts why in that rawness left you wife and child those precious motives those strong knots of love without leavetaking i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonours but mine own safeties you may be rightly just whatever i shall think be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you i think our country sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash is added to her wounds i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but for all this when i shall tread upon the tyrants head or wear it on my sword yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before more suffer and more sundry ways than ever by him that shall succeed it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that when they shall be opend black macbeth will seem as pure as snow and the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compared with my confineless harms i grant him bloody luxurious avaricious false deceitful sudden malicious smacking of every sin that has a name but theres no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would oerbear that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign with this there grows in my most illcomposed affection such a stanchless avarice that were i king i should cut off the nobles for their lands desire his jewels and this others house and my morehaving would be as a sauce to make me hunger more that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal destroying them for wealth but i have none the kingbecoming graces as justice verity temperance stableness bounty perseverance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude i have no relish of them but abound in the division of each several crime acting it many ways nay had i power i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell uproar the universal peace confound all unity on earth if such a one be fit to govern speak i am as i have spoken macduff this noble passion child of integrity hath from my soul wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honour devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power and modest wisdom plucks me from overcredulous haste but god above deal between thee and me for even now i put myself to thy direction and unspeak mine own detraction here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself for strangers to my nature i am yet unknown to woman never was forsworn scarcely have coveted what was mine own at no time broke my faith would not betray the devil to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life my first false speaking was this upon myself what i am truly is thine and my poor countrys to command whither indeed before thy hereapproach old siward with ten thousand warlike men already at a point was setting forth now well together and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel why are you silent well more anoncomes the king forth i pray you i thank you doctor tis calld the evil a most miraculous work in this good king which often since my hereremain in england i have seen him do how he solicits heaven himself best knows but strangelyvisited people all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye the mere despair of surgery he cures hanging a golden stamp about their necks put on with holy prayers and tis spoken to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace my countryman but yet i know him not i know him now good god betimes remove the means that makes us strangers whats the newest grief bet their comfort we are coming thither gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out merciful heaven what man neer pull your hat upon your brows give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break be comforted lets make us medicines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief dispute it like a man be this the whetstone of your sword let grief convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it this tune goes manly come go we to the king our power is ready our lack is nothing but our leave macbeth is ripe for shaking and the powers above put on their instruments receive what cheer you may the night is long that never finds the day cousins i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe let every soldier hew him down a bough and beart before him thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us tis his main hope for where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt and none serve with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too now near enough your leafy screens throw down and show like those you are you worthy uncle shall with my cousin your rightnoble son lead our first battle worthy macduff and we shall take upon s what else remains to do according to our order we have met with foes that strike beside us i would the friends we miss were safe arrived macduff is missing and your noble son hes worth more sorrow and that ill spend for him we shall not spend a large expense of time before we reckon with your several loves and make us even with you my thanes and kinsmen henceforth be earls the first that ever scotland in such an honour named whats more to do which would be planted newly with the time as calling home our exiled friends abroad that fled the snares of watchful tyranny producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen who as tis thought by self and violent hands took off her life this and what needful else that calls upon us by the grace of grace we will perform in measure time and place so thanks to all at once and to each one whom we invite to see us crownd at sconedoubtful it stood as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art the merciless macdonwald worthy to be a rebel for to that the multiplying villanies of nature do swarm upon himfrom the western isles of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling showd like a rebels whore but alls too weak for brave macbethwell he deserves that name disdaining fortune with his brandishd steel which smoked with bloody execution like valours minion carved out his passage till he faced the slave which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps and fixd his head upon our battlements as whence the sun gins his reflection shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break so from that spring whence comfort seemd to come discomfort swells mark king of scotland mark no sooner justice had with valour armd compelld these skipping kerns to trust their heels but the norweyan lord surveying vantage with furbishd arms and new supplies of men began a fresh assault yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion if i say sooth i must report they were as cannons overcharged with double cracks so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds or memorise another golgotha i cannot tell but i am faint my gashes cry for helpwhat a haste looks through his eyes so should he look that seems to speak things strange good morrow noble sir goes the king hence today the night has been unruly where we lay our chimneys were blown down and as they say lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events new hatchd to the woeful time the obscure bird clamourd the livelong night some say the earth was feverous and did shake my young remembrance cannot parallel a fellow to it whats the matter mean you his majesty those of his chamber as it seemd had done t their hands and faces were an badged with blood so were their daggers which unwiped we found upon their pillows they stared and were distracted no mans life was to be trusted with them mayt please your highness sit here is a place reserved sir here my good lord what ist that moves your highness good night and better health attend his majesty my former speeches have but hit your thoughts which can interpret further only i say things have been strangely borne the gracious duncan was pitied of macbeth marry he was dead and the rightvaliant banquo walkd too late whom you may say ift please you fleance killd for fleance fled men must not walk too late who cannot want the thought how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain to kill their gracious father damned fact how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep was not that nobly done ay and wisely too for twould have angerd any heart alive to hear the men denyt so that i say he has borne all things well and i do think that had he duncans sons under his key as ant please heaven he shall notthey should find what twere to kill a father so should fleance but peace for from broad words and cause he faild his presence at the tyrants feast i hear macduff lives in disgrace sir can you tell where he bestows himself sent he to macduff and that well might advise him to a caution to hold what distance his wisdom can provide some holy angel fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed whats your graces will no my lord no indeed my lord tis two or three my lord that bring you word macduff is fled to england ay my good lord for certain sir he is not i have a file of all the gentry there is siwards son and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds make we our march towards birnamgod save the king from fife great king where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold norway himself with terrible numbers assisted by that most disloyal traitor the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict till that bellonas bridegroom lappd in proof confronted him with selfcomparisons point against point rebellious arm gainst arm curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude the victory fell on us that now sweno the norways king craves composition nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed at saint colmes inch ten thousand dollars to our general use ill see it done the king hath happily received macbeth the news of thy success and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels fight his wonders and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenced with that in viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks nothing afeard of what thyself didst make strange images of death as thick as hail came post with post and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdoms great defence and pourd them down before him and for an earnest of a greater honour he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor in which addition hail most worthy thane for it is thine ah good father thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act threaten his bloody stage by the clock tis day and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp ist nights predominance or the days shame that darkness does the face of earth entomb when living light should kiss it and duncans horsesa thing most strange and certain beauteous and swift the minions of their race turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out contending gainst obedience as they would make war with mankind they did so to the amazement of mine eyes that lookd upont here comes the good macduff   how goes the world sir now ist known who did this more than bloody deed alas the day what good could they pretend gainst nature still thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up thine own lifes means then tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth where is duncans body will you to scone well i will thither farewell father his absence sir lays blame upon his promise pleaset your highness to grace us with your royal company gentlemen rise his highness is not well what sights my lord you must have patience madam you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear my dearest coz i pray you school yourself but for your husband he is noble wise judicious and best knows the fits o the season i dare not speak much further but cruel are the times when we are traitors and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour from what we fear yet know not what we fear but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move i take my leave of you shall not be long but ill be here again things at the worst will cease or else climb upward to what they were before my pretty cousin blessing upon you i am so much a fool should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort i take my leave at once sir amen alas poor country almost afraid to know itself it cannot be calld our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air are made not markd where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy the dead mans knell is there scarce askd for who and good mens lives expire before the flowers in their caps dying or ere they sicken that of an hours age doth hiss the speaker each minute teems a new one why well well too no they were well at peace when i did leave em when i came hither to transport the tidings which i have heavily borne there ran a rumour of many worthy fellows that were out which was to my belief witnessd the rather for that i saw the tyrants power afoot now is the time of help your eye in scotland would create soldiers make our women fight to doff their dire distresses would i could answer this comfort with the like but i have words that would be howld out in the desert air where hearing should not latch them no mind thats honest but in it shares some woe though the main part pertains to you alone let not your ears despise my tongue for ever which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard your castle is surprised your wife and babes savagely slaughterd to relate the manner were on the quarry of these murderd deer to add the death of you wife children servants all that could be found i have said your son my lord has paid a soldiers debt he only lived but till he was a man the which no sooner had his prowess confirmd in the unshrinking station where he fought but like a man he died ay and brought off the field your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth for then it hath no end ay on the frontkilling swine show me show me all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor hail not so happy yet much happier thrice and once the hedgepig whined demand showso foul and fair a day i have not seen speak if you can what are you stay you imperfect speakers tell me more by sinels death i know i am thane of glamis but how of cawdor the thane of cawdor lives a prosperous gentleman and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief no more than to be cawdor say from whence you owe this strange intelligence or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting speak i charge you into the air and what seemd corporal melted as breath into the wind would they had stayd your children shall be kings and thane of cawdor too went it not so the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me in borrowd robes aside  glamis and thane of cawdor the greatest is behind   thanks for your pains   do you not hope your children shall be kings when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me promised no less to them asidetwo truths are told as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial themei thank you gentlemen   cannot be ill cannot be good if ill why hath it given me earnest of success commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor if good why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature present fears are less than horrible imaginings my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical shakes so my single state of man that function is smotherd in surmise and nothing is but what is not aside  if chance will have me king why chance may crown me without my stir aside                come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day give me your favour my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten kind gentlemen your pains are registerd where every day i turn the leaf to read them let us toward the king think upon what hath chanced and at more time the interim having weighd it let us speak our free hearts each to other till then enough come friends the service and the loyalty i owe in doing it pays itself your highness part is to receive our duties and our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should by doing every thing safe toward your love and honour the rest is labour which is not used for you ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach so humbly take my leave aside  the prince of cumberland that is a step on which i must fall down or else oerleap for in my way it lies stars hide your fires let not light see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the hand yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see they met me in the day of success and i have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge when i burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king who allhailed me thane of cawdor by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with hail king that shalt be this have i thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee lay it to thy heart and farewell glamis thou art and cawdor and shalt be what thou art promised yet do i fear thy nature it is too full o the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way thou wouldst be great art not without ambition but without the illness should attend it what thou wouldst highly that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false and yet wouldst wrongly win thouldst have great glamis that which cries thus thou must do if thou have it and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone hie thee hither that i may pour my spirits in thine ear and chastise with the valour of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crownd withal   what is your tidings my dearest love duncan comes here tonight and when goes hence tomorrow as he purposes we will speak further only look up clear to alter favour ever is to fear leave all the rest to me if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly if the assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success that but this blow might be the beall and the endall here but here upon this bank and shoal of time weld jump the life to come but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague the inventor this evenhanded justice commends the ingredients of our poisond chalice to our own lips hes here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpettongued against the deep damnation of his takingoff and pity like a naked newborn babe striding the blast or heavens cherubim horsed upon the sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye that tears shall drown the wind i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself and falls on the other   how now what news hath he askd for me know you not he has we will proceed no further in this business he hath honourd me of late and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss not cast aside so soon prithee peace i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is none if we should fail bring forth menchildren only for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males will it not be received when we have markd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have donet i am settled and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat away and mock the time with fairest show false face must hide what the false heart doth know a friend being unprepared our will became the servant to defect which else should free have wrought i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time if you shall cleave to my consent when tis it shall make honour for you good repose the while go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready she strike upon the bell get thee to bed   is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee i have thee not and yet i see thee still art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heatoppressed brain i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw thou marshallst me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses or else worth all the rest i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before theres no such thing it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes now oer the one halfworld nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtaind sleep witchcraft celebrates pale hecates offerings and witherd murder alarumd by his sentinel the wolf whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace with tarquins ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost thou sure and firmset earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout and take the present horror from the time which now suits with it whiles i threat he lives words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives   i go and it is done the bell invites me hear it not duncan for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold what hath quenchd them hath given me fire hark peace it was the owl that shriekd the fatal bellman which gives the sternst goodnight he is about it the doors are open and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have druggd their possets that death and nature do contend about them whether they live or die within  whos there what ho i have done the deed didst thou not hear a noise when as i descended ay hark who lies i the second chamber this is a sorry sight a foolish thought to say a sorry sight theres one did laugh ins sleep and one cried murder that they did wake each other i stood and heard them but they did say their prayers and addressd them again to sleep one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangmans hands listening their fear i could not say amen when they did say god bless us but wherefore could not i pronounce amen i had most need of blessing and amen stuck in my throat these deeds must not be thought after these ways so it will make us mad methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravelld sleeve of care the death of each days life sore labours bath balm of hurt minds great natures

heapd up to them we rest your hermits your servants ever have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt to make their audit at your highness pleasure still to return your own he has almost suppd why have you left the chamber was the hope drunk wherein you dressd yourself hath it slept since and wakes it now to look so green and pale at what it did so freely from this time such i account thy

dare not wait upon i would like the poor cat i the adage what beast wast then that made you break this enterprise to me when you durst do it then you were a man and to be more than what you were you would be so much more the man nor time nor place did then adhere and yet you would make both they have made themselves and that their fitness now does unmake you i have given suck and know how tender tis to love the babe that milks me i would while it was smiling in my face have pluckd my nipple from his boneless gums and dashd the brains out had i so sworn as you have done to this we fail but screw your courage to the stickingplace and well not fail when duncan is asleep whereto the rather shall his days hard journey soundly invite himhis two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince that memory the warder of the brain shall be a fume and the receipt of reason a limbeck only when in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death what cannot you and i perform upon the unguarded duncan what not put upon his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt of our great quell who dares receive it other as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar upon his death alack i am afraid they have awaked and tis not done the attempt and not the deed confounds us hark i laid their daggers ready he could not miss em had he not resembled my father as he slept i had donet   my husband i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry did not you speak now donalbain there are two lodged together consider it not so deeply what do you mean who was it that thus cried why worthy thane

carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood infirm of purpose give me the daggers the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil if he do bleed ill gild the faces of the grooms withal for it must seem their guilt help me hence ho if he had been forgotten it had been as a gap in our great feast and allthing unbecoming say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words noughts had alls spent where our desire is got without content tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy   how now my lord why

walked a great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching in this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say you may to me and tis most meet you should how came she by that light you see her eyes are open what is it she does now look how she rubs her hands hark she speaks i will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly do you mark that go to go to you have known what you should not what a sigh is there the heart is sorely charged well well well this disease is beyond my practise yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds even so will she go now to bed foul whisperings are abroad unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles infected minds to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets more needs she the divine than the physician god god forgive us all look after her remove from her the means of all annoyance and still keep eyes upon her so good night my mind she has mated and amazed my sight i think but dare not speak not so sick my lord as she is troubled with thick coming fancies that keep her from her rest therein the patient must minister to himself ay my good lord your royal preparation makes us hear something aside  were i from dunsinane away and clear profit again should hardly draw me heresince his majesty went into the field i have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upont read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep that sir which i will not report after her neither to you nor any one having no witness to confirm my speech   lo you here she comes this is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep observe her stand close why it stood by her she has light by her continually tis her command ay but their sense is shut it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands i have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour she has spoke what she should not i am sure of that heaven knows what she has known i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body pray god it be sir directly good night good doctorthe english power is near led on by malcolm his uncle siward and the good macduff revenges burn in them for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm excite the mortified man what does the tyrant who then shall blame his pesterd senses to recoil and start when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there we doubt it nothing the wood of birnamwho knows if donalbain be with his brother great dunsinane he strongly fortifies some say hes mad others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury but for certain he cannot buckle his distemperd cause within the belt of rule well march we on to give obedience where tis truly owed meet we the medicine of the sickly weal and with him pour we in our countrys purge each drop of uswhat is your gracious pleasure all is confirmd my lord which was reported tis not needed yet it is the cry of women my good lord the queen my lord is deadwhat wood is this before us we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane and will endure our setting down before t the time approaches that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate but certain issue strokes must arbitrate towards which advance the war fare you well do
