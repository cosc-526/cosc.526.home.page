would i very shortly see thee there but come what may i do adore thee so that danger shall seem sport and i will go i could not stay behind you my desire more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth and not all love to see you though so much as might have drawn one to a longer voyage but jealousy what might befall your travel being skilless in these parts which to a stranger unguided and unfriended often prove rough and unhospitable my willing love the rather by these arguments of fear set forth in your pursuit tomorrow sir best first go see your lodging would yould pardon me i do not without danger walk these streets once in a seafight gainst the count his galleys i did some service of such note indeed that were i taen here it would scarce be answerd the offence is not of such a bloody nature albeit the quality of the time and quarrel might well have given us bloody argument it might have since been answerd in repaying what we took from them which for traffics sake most of our city did only myself stood out for which if i be lapsed in this place i shall pay dear it doth not fit me hold sir heres my purse in the south suburbs at the elephant is best to lodge i will bespeak our diet whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge with viewing of the town there shall you have me haply your eye shall light upon some toy you have desire to purchase and your store i think is not for idle markets sir to the elephant put up your sword if this young gentleman have done offence i take the fault on me if you offend him i for him defy you one sir that for his love dares yet do more than you have heard him brag to you he will you do mistake me sir i must obey   this comes with seeking you but theres no remedy i shall answer it what will you do now my necessity makes me to ask you for my purse it grieves me much more for what i cannot do for you than what befalls myself you stand amazed but be of comfort i must entreat of you some of that money will you deny me now ist possible that my deserts to you can lack persuasion do not tempt my misery lest that it make me so unsound a man as to upbraid you with those kindnesses that i have done for you o heavens themselves let me speak a little this youth that you see here i snatchd one half out of the jaws of death relieved him with such sanctity of love and to his image which methought did promise most venerable worth did i devotion but o how vile an idol proves this god thou hast sebastian done good feature shame in nature theres no blemish but the mind none can be calld deformd but the unkind virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil are empty trunks oerflourishd by the devil lead me on orsino noble sir be pleased that i shake off these names you give me antonio never yet was thief or pirate though i confess on base and ground enough orsinos enemy a witchcraft drew me hither that most ingrateful boy there by your side from the rude seas enraged and foamy mouth did i redeem a wreck past hope he was his life i gave him and did thereto add my love without retention or restraint all his in dedication for his sake did i expose myself pure for his love into the danger of this adverse town drew to defend him when he was beset where being apprehended his false cunning not meaning to partake with me in danger taught him to face me out of his acquaintance and grew a twenty years removed thing while one would wink denied me mine own purse which i had recommended to his use not half an hour before today my lord and for three months before no interim not a minutes vacancy both day and night did we keep company sebastian are you how have you made division of yourself an apple cleft in two is not more twin than these two creatures which is sebastianby your patience no my stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore i shall crave of you your leave that i may bear my evils alone it were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you antonio let me yet know of you whither you are bound no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself you must know of me then antonio my name is sebastian which i called roderigo my father was that sebastian of messaline whom i know you have heard of he left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased would we had so ended but you sir altered that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned a lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful but though i could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that yet thus far i will boldly publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair she is drowned already sir with salt water though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more o good antonio forgive me your trouble if you will not undo what you have done that is kill him whom you have recovered desire it not fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and i am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me i am bound to the count orsinos court farewell i would not by my will have troubled you but since you make your pleasure of your pains i will no further chide you my kind antonio i can no other answer make but thanks and thanks and ever   oft good turns are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay but were my worth as is my conscience firm you should find better dealing whats to do shall we go see the reliques of this town i am not weary and tis long to night i pray you let us satisfy our eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that do renown this city belike you slew great number of his people do not then walk too open why i your purse ill be your pursebearer and leave you for an hour i do remember go to go to thou art a foolish fellow let me be clear of thee i prithee vent thy folly somewhere else thou knowst not me i prithee foolish greek depart from me theres money for thee if you tarry longer i shall give worse payment why theres for thee and there and there are all the people mad let go thy hand i will be free from thee what wouldst thou now if thou darest tempt me further draw thy sword what relish is in this how runs the stream or i am mad or else this is a dream let fancy still my sense in lethe steep if it be thus to dream still let me sleep madam i will this is the air that is the glorious sun this pearl she gave me i do feelt and seet and though tis wonder that enwraps me thus yet tis not madness wheres antonio then i could not find him at the elephant yet there he was and there i found this credit that he did range the town to seek me out his counsel now might do me golden service for though my soul disputes well with my sense that this may be some error but no madness yet doth this accident and flood of fortune so far exceed all instance all discourse that i am ready to distrust mine eyes and wrangle with my reason that persuades me to any other trust but that i am mad or else the ladys mad yet if twere so she could not sway her house command her followers take and give back affairs and their dispatch with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing as i perceive she does theres something int that is deceiveable but here the lady comes ill follow this good man and go with you and having sworn truth ever will be true i am sorry madam i have hurt your kinsman but had it been the brother of my blood i must have done no less with wit and safety you throw a strange regard upon me and by that i do perceive it hath offended you pardon me sweet one even for the vows we made each other but so late ago antonio o my dear antonio how have the hours rackd and tortured me since i have lost thee fearst thou that antonio do i stand there i never had a brother nor can there be that deity in my nature of here and every where i had a sister whom the blind waves and surges have devourd of charity what kin are you to me what countryman what name what parentage a spirit i am indeed but am in that dimension grossly clad which from the womb i did participate were you a woman as the rest goes even i should my tears let fall upon your cheek and say thricewelcome drowned viola and so had mine o that record is lively in my soul he finished indeed his mortal act that day that made my sister thirteen years to olivia  so comes it lady you have been mistook but nature to her bias drew in that you would have been contracted to a maid nor are you therein by my life deceived you are betrothd both to a maid and mannay ill come if i lose a scruple of this sport let me be boiled to death with melancholy i would exult man you know he brought me out o favour with my lady about a bearbaiting here o peace contemplation

us with cars yet peace nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot now is the woodcock near the gin this wins him liver and all a fustian riddle what dish o poison has she dressed him sowter will cry upont for all this though it be as rank as a fox did not i say he would work it out the cur is excellent at faults and o shall end i hope ay an you had any eye behind you you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you i will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the sophy here comes my noble gullcatcher you must needs yield your reason sir andrew this was a great argument of love in her toward you i will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason she did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver you should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness this was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my ladys opinion where you will hang like an icicle on a dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy there is no way but this sir andrew this is a dear manikin to you sir toby we shall have a rare letter from him but youll not delivert and his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty here he is here he is how ist with you sir how ist with you man carry his water to the wise woman no way but gentleness gently gently the fiend is rough and will not be roughly used if this were played upon a stage now i could condemn it as an improbable fiction why we shall make him mad indeed more matter for a may morning ist so saucy good and valiant a good note that keeps you from the blow of the law very brief and to exceeding good senseless good still you keep o the windy side of the law good here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after him i know the knight is incensed against you even to a mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour he is indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of illyria will you walk towards him i will make your peace with him if i can he is as horribly conceited of him and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his heels give ground if you see him furious o good sir toby hold here come the officers a coward a most devout coward religious in it come lets see the event now as thou lovest me let me see his letter any thing this is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again reads  by the lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it though you have put me into
