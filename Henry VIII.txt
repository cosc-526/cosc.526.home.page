the whole time i was my chambers prisoner o you go far who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess i pray you who my lord the devil speed him no mans pie is freed from his ambitious finger what had he to do in these fierce vanities i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o the beneficial sun and keep it from the earth why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o the king to appoint who should attend on him he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in the papers o many have broke their backs with laying manors on em for this great journey what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue every man after the hideous storm that followd was a thing inspired and not consulting broke into a general prophecy that this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach ont why all this business our reverend cardinal carried this butchers cur is venommouthd and i have not the power to muzzle him therefore best not wake him in his slumber a beggars book outworths a nobles blood i read ins looks matter against me and his eye reviled me as his abject object at this instant he bores me with some trick hes gone to the king ill follow and outstare him ill to the king and from a mouth of honour quite cry down this ipswich fellows insolence or proclaim theres difference in no persons sir i am thankful to you and ill go along by your prescription but this topproud fellow whom from the flow of gall i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of gravel i do know to be corrupt and treasonous to the king ill sayt and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock attend this holy fox or wolf or bothfor he is equal ravenous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to performt his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty the interview that swallowd so much treasure and like a glass did break i the rinsing pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal the articles o the combination drew as himself pleased and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to the dead but our countcardinal has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it now this follows which as i take it is a kind of puppy to the old dam treasoncharles the emperor under pretence to see the queen his aunt for twas indeed his colour but he came to whisper wolseyhere makes visitation his fears were that the interview betwixt england and france might through their amity breed him some prejudice for from this league peepd harms that menaced him he privily deals with our cardinal and as i trow which i do well for i am sure the emperor paid ere he promised whereby his suit was granted ere it was askd but when the way was made and paved with gold the emperor thus desired that he would please to alter the kings course and break the foresaid peace let the king know as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases and for his own advantage no not a syllable i do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof lo you my lord the net has falln upon me i shall perish under device and practise it will help me nothing to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me which makes my whitest part black the will of heaven be done in this and all things i obey o my lord abergavenny fare you well so so these are the

the premises but justice but those that sought it i could wish more christians be what they will i heartily forgive em yet let em look they glory not in mischief nor build their evils on the graves of great men for then my guiltless blood must cry against em for further life in this world i neer hope nor will i sue although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults you few that loved me

to his end goodness and he fill up one monument nay sir nicholas let it alone my state now will but mock me when i came hither i was lord high constable and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun yet i am richer than my base accusers that never knew what truth meant i now seal it and with that blood will make em one day groan fort my noble father henry of buckingham who first raised head against usurping richard flying for succor to his servant banister being distressd was by that wretch betrayd and without trial fell gods peace be with him henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying my fathers loss like a most royal prince restored me to my honours and out of ruins made my name once more noble now his son henry the eighth life honour name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world i had my trial and must needs say a noble one which makes me a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortunes both fell by our servants by those men we loved most a most unnatural and faithless service heaven has an end in all yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose for those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye all good people pray for me i must now forsake ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me farewell and when you would say something that is sad speak how i fell i have done and god forgive mei thank your grace healthful and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four throned ones could have weighd such a compounded one then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself each following day became the next days master till the last made former wonders its today the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and tomorrow they made britain india every man that stood showd like a mine their dwarfish pages were as cherubins all guilt the madams too not used to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labour was to them as a painting now this masque was cried incomparable and the ensuing night made it a fool and beggar the two kings equal in lustre were now best now worst as presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both twas said they saw but one and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure when these suns for so they phrase emby their heralds challenged the noble spirits to arms they did perform beyond thoughts compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believed as i belong to worship and affect in honour honesty the tract of every thing would by a good discourser lose some life which actions self was tongue to all was royal to the disposing of it nought rebelld order gave each thing view the office did distinctly his full function one certes that promises no element in such a business all this was orderd by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york surely sir theres in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not proppd by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor calld upon for high feats done to the crown neither allied for eminent assistants but spiderlike out of his selfdrawing web he gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it which is budded out for france hath flawd the league and hath attachd our merchants goods at bourdeaux marry ist like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safetythat you read the cardinals malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power you know his nature that hes revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edge its long and t may be said it reaches far and where twill not extend thither he darts it bosom up my counsel youll find it wholesome lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning what are you chafed ask god for temperance thats the appliance only which your disease requires stay my lord and let your reason with your choler question what tis you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a fullhot horse who being allowd his way selfmettle tires him not a man in england can advise me like you be to yourself as you would to your friend be advised heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself we may outrun by violent swiftness that which we run at and lose by overrunning know you not the fire that mounts the liquor til run oer in seeming to augment it wastes it be advised i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion say not treasonous faith and so it did i am sorry to hear this of him and could wish he were something mistaken int not almost appears it doth appear for upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put off the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compelld by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring the event to the teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among then well met my lord chamberlain whats the cause tis so this is the cardinals doing the kingcardinal that blind priest like the eldest son of fortune turns what he list the king will know him one day how holily he works in all his business and with what zeal for now he has crackd the league between us and the emperor the queens great nephew he dives into the kings soul and there scatters dangers doubts wringing of the conscience fears and despairs and all these for his marriage and out of all these to restore the king he counsels a divorce a loss of her that like a jewel has hung twenty years about his neck yet never lost her lustre of her that loves him with that excellence that angels love good men with even of her that when the greatest stroke of fortune falls will bless the king and is not this course pious we had need pray and heartily for our deliverance or this imperious man will work us all from princes into pages all mens honours lie like one lump before him to be fashiond into what pitch he please lets in and with some other business put the king from these sad thoughts that work too much upon him my lord youll bear us company thanks my good lord chamberlain pray god he be not angry a gracious king that pardons all offences malice neer meant our breach of duty this way is business of estate in which we come to know your royal pleasure aside to suffolk this priest has no pride in him aside to suffolk      if it do ill venture one haveathim if you will now unite in your complaints and force them with a constancy the cardinal cannot stand under them if you omit the offer of this time i cannot promise but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces with these you bear already o fear him not his spell in that is out the king hath found matter against him that for ever mars the honey of his language no hes settled not to come off in his displeasure believe it this is true in the divorce his contrary proceedings are all unfolded wherein he appears as i would wish mine enemy all mens marry amen but my lord when returns cranmer this same cranmers a worthy fellow and hath taen much pain in the kings business so i hear observe observe hes moody hes discontented he is vexd at something my lord we have stood here observing him some strange commotion is in his brain he bites his lip and starts stops on a sudden looks upon the ground then lays his finger on his temple straight springs out into fast gait then stops again strikes his breast hard and anon he casts his eye against the moon in most strange postures we have seen him set himself its heavens will some spirit put this paper in the packet to bless your eye withal hear the kings pleasure cardinal who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands and to confine yourself to asher house my lord of winchesters till you hear further from his highness those articles my lord are in the kings

leave you to your meditations how to live better for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you so fare you well my little good lord cardinal who waits there do you think my lords the king will suffer but the little finger of this man to be vexdi cannot tell what heaven hath given himlet some graver eye pierce into that but i can see his pride peep through each part of him whence has he that if not from hell the devil is a niggard or has given all before and he begins a new hell in himself i do know kinsmen of mine three

more than mine own that am have and will be though all the world should crack their duty to you and throw it from their soul though perils did abound as thick as thought could make em and appear in forms more horridyet my duty as doth a rock against the chiding flood should the approach of this wild river break and stand unshaken yours what should this mean what sudden angers this how have i reapd it he parted frowning from me as if ruin leapd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion upon the daring huntsman that has galld him then makes him nothing i must read this paper i fear the story of his anger tis so this paper has undone me tis the account of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome o negligence fit for a fool to fall by what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king is there no way to cure this no new device to beat this from his brains i know twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again whats this to the pope the letter as i live with all the business i writ tos holiness nay then farewell i have touchd the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting i shall fall like a bright exhalation m the evening and no man see me more till i find more than will or words to do it i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it now i feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy how eagerly ye follow my disgraces as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honours during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letterspatents now wholl take it it must be himself then proud lord thou liest within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness if i loved many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honour that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and all that love his follies all goodness is poison to thy stomach so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth speak on sir i dare your worst objections if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners so farewell to the little good you bear me farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honours thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is aripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my highblown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye i feel my heart new opend o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favours there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again   why how now cromwell what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay an you weep i am falln indeed i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weakhearted enemies dare offer what news abroad god bless him thats somewhat sudden but hes a learned man may he continue long in his highness favour and do justice for truths sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on em what more thats news indeed there was the weight that pulld me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost for ever no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor falln man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him i know his noble naturenot to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman lets dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missd it mark but my fall and that that ruind me cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys thy gods and truths then if thou fallst o cromwell thou fallst a blessed martyr serve the king andprithee lead me in there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny tis the kings my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwellhere so please you ay please your graceis he in person ready and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not passd me but by learned approbation of the judges if i am traduced by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow that is newtrimmd but benefit no further than vainly longing what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allowd what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mockd or carpd at we should take root here where we sit or sit statestatues only now madam may his highness live in freedom and this man out of prison whats that what warlike voice and to what end is this nay ladies fear not by all the laws of war youre privileged say lord chamberlain they have done my poor house grace for which i pay em a thousand thanks and pray em take their pleasures my lord what say they your grace i fear

how dare you thrust yourselves into my private meditations who am i ha to norfolk and suffolk we are busy go and once more in mine arms i bid him welcome and thank the holy conclave for their loves they have sent me such a man i would have wishd for two equal men the queen shall be acquainted forthwith for what you come wheres gardiner come hither gardiner whats the need it hath already publicly been read and on all sides the authority allowd you may then spare that time here call her again my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honour i free you fromt you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to villagecurs bark when their fellows do by some of these the queen is put in anger youre excused but will you be more justified you ever have wishd the sleeping of this business never desired it to be stirrd but oft have hinderd oft the passages made toward it on my honour i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him now what moved me tot i will be bold with time and your attention then mark the inducement thus it came give heed tot my conscience first received a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches utterd by the bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary i the progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometimes our brothers wife this respite shook the bosom of my conscience enterd me yea with a splitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forced such way that many mazed considerings did throng and pressd in with this caution first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my ladys womb if it conceived a male child by me should do no more offices of life tot than the grave does to the dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had aird them hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o the world should not be gladded int by me then follows that i weighd the danger which my realms stood in by this my issues fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together thats to say i meant to rectify my consciencewhich i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learnd first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first moved you i then moved you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i the world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons drive this forward prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our mortal state to come with her katharine our queen before the primest creature thats paragond o the world asidei may perceive these cardinals trifle with me i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome my learnd and wellbeloved servant cranmer prithee return with thy approach i know my comfort comes along break up the court i say set on it may well be there is a mutiny ins mind this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i required and wot you what i found thereon my conscience put unwittingly forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject you have said well have i not made you the prime man of the state i pray you tell me if what i now pronounce you have found true and if you may confess it say withal if you are bound to us or no what say you fairly answerd a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honour of it does pay the act of it as i the contrary the foulness is the punishment i presume that as my hand has opend bounty to you my heart droppd love my power raind honour more on you than any so your hand and heart your brain and every function of your power should notwithstanding that your bond of duty as twere in loves particular be more to me your friend than any tis nobly spoken take notice lords he has a loyal breast for you have seen him opent read oer this   and after this and then to breakfast with what appetite you have charles i

without indurance further know you not how your state stands i the world with the whole world your enemies are many and not small their practises must bear the same proportion and not ever the justice and the truth o the question carries the due o the verdict with it at what ease might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt to swear against you such things have been done you are potently opposed and with a malice of as great size ween you of better luck i mean in perjured witness than your master whose minister you are whiles here he lived upon this naughty earth go to go to you take a

their ease and sleep an act or two but those we fear we have frighted with our trumpets so tis clear theyll say tis naught others to hear the city abused extremely and to cry thats witty which we have not done neither that i fear all the expected good were like to hear for this play at this time is only in the merciful construction of good women for such a one we showd em if they smile and say twill do i know within a while all the best men are ours for tis ill hap if they hold when their ladies bid em clapthank your majesty that you would love yourself and in that love not unconsiderd leave your honour nor the dignity of your office is the point of my petition i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among em which hath flawd the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master whose honour heaven shield from soileven he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to the bearing and to bear em the back is sacrifice to the load they say they are devised by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am boldend under your promised pardon the subjects grief comes through commissions which compel from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretence for this is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and its come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business my learnd lord cardinal deliver all with charity if i know you well you were the dukes surveyor and lost your office on the complaint o the tenants take good heed you charge not in your spleen a noble person and spoil your nobler soul i say take heed yes heartily beseech you god mend all sir i desire you do me right and justice and to bestow your pity on me for i am a most poor woman and a stranger born out of your dominions having here no judge indifferent nor no more assurance of equal friendship and proceeding alas sir in what have i offended you what cause hath my behavior given to your displeasure that thus you should proceed to put me off and take your good grace from me heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wife at all times to your will conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too or which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger did i continue in my liking nay gave notice he was from thence discharged sir call to mind that i have been your wife in this obedience upward of twenty years and have been blest with many children by you if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honour aught my bond to wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in gods name turn me away and let the foulst contempt shut door upon me and so give me up to the sharpst kind of justice please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatchd wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckond one the wisest prince that there had reignd by many a year before it is not to be questiond that they had gatherd a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deemd our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not i the name of god your pleasure be fulfilld lord cardinal to you i speak sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dreamd so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears ill turn to sparks of fire my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak to oppose your cunning youre meek and humblemouthd you sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is crammd with arrogancy spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness favours gone slightly oer low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will ast please yourself pronounce their office i must tell you you tender more your persons honour than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause fore his holiness and to be judged by him what need you note it pray you keep your way when you are calld return now the lord help they vex me past my patience pray you pass on i will not tarry no nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles sing and disperse em if thou canst leave working   orpheus with his lute made trees and the mountain tops that freeze bow themselves when he did sing to his music plants and flowers ever sprung as sun and showers there had made a lasting spring every thing that heard him play even the billows of the sea hung their heads and then lay by in sweet music is such art killing care and grief of heart fall asleep or hearing die would they speak with me pray their graces to come near   what can be their business with me a poor weak woman falln from favour i do not like their coming now i think ont they should be good men their affairs as righteous but all hoods make not monks your graces find me here part of a housewife i would be all against the worst may happen what are your pleasures with me reverend lords speak it here theres nothing i have done yet o my conscience deserves a corner would all other women could speak this with as free a soul as i do my lords i care not so much i am happy above a number if my actions were tried by every tongue every eye saw em envy and base opinion set against em i know my life so even if your business seek me out and that way i am wife in out with it boldly truth loves open dealing asideto betray me my lords i thank you both for your good wills ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so but how to make ye suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honour more near my life i fearwith my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business for her sake that i have beenfor i feel the last fit of my greatnessgood your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any englishman dare give me counsel or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject nay forsooth my friends they that must weigh out my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my other comforts far hence in mine own country lords how sir the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye mend em for shame my lords is this your comfort the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady a woman lost among ye laughd at scornd i will not wish ye half my miseries i have more charity but say i warnd ye take heed for heavens sake take heed lest at once the burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye ye turn me into nothing woe upon ye and all such false professors would you have me if you have any justice any pity if ye be any thing but churchmens habits put my sick cause into his hands that hates me alas has banishd me his bed already his love too long ago i am old my lords and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience what can happen to me above this wretchedness all your studies make me a curse like this my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall eer divorce my dignities do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me if i have used myself unmannerly you know i am a woman lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life come reverend fathers bestow your counsels on me she now begs that little thought when she set footing here she should have bought her dignities so dearfirst it was usual with him every day it would infect his speech that if the king should without issue die hell carry it so to make the sceptre his these very words ive heard him utter to his soninlaw lord abergavenny to whom by oath he menaced revenge upon the cardinal he was brought to this by a vain prophecy of nicholas hopkins sir a chartreux friar his confessor who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty not long before your highness sped to france the duke being at the rose within the parish saint lawrence poultney did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey i replied men feard the french would prove perfidious to the kings danger presently the duke said twas the fear indeed and that he doubted twould prove the verity of certain words spoke by a holy monk that oft says he hath sent to me wishing me to permit john de la car my chaplain a choice hour to hear from him a matter of some moment whom after under the confessions seal he solemnly had sworn that what he spoke my chaplain to no creature living but to me should utter with demure confidence this pausingly ensued neither the king nors heirs tell you the duke shall prosper bid him strive to gain the love o the commonalty the duke shall govern england on my soul ill speak but truth i told my lord the duke by the devils illusions the monk might be deceived and that twas dangerous for him to ruminate on this so far until it forged him some design which being believed it was much like to do he answerd tush it can do me no damage adding further that had the king in his last sickness faild the cardinals and sir thomas lovells heads should have gone off i can my liege being at greenwich after your highness had reproved the duke about sir william blomer if quoth he i for this had been committed as to the tower i thought i would have playd the part my father meant to act upon the usurper richard who being at salisbury made suit to come ins presence which if granted as he made semblance of his duty would have put his knife to him after the duke his father with the knife he stretchd him and with one hand on his dagger another spread ons breast mounting his eyes he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenor waswere he evil used he would outgo his father by as much as a performance does an irresolute purposespeak on how grounded he his title to the crown upon our fail to this point hast thou heard him at any time speak aught how knowst thou this i remember of such a time being my sworn servant the duke retaind him his but on what hence my lord chamberlain prithee come hither what fair ladys that by heaven she is a dainty one sweetheart i were unmannerly to take you out and not to kiss you a health gentlemen let it go round deliver this with modesty to the queen   the most convenient place that i can think of for such receipt of learning is blackfriars there ye shall meet about this weighty business my wolsey see it furnishd o my lord would it not grieve an able man to leave so sweet a bedfellow but conscience conscience o tis a tender place and i must leave her if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fixd on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering good my lord you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind the which you were now running oer you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure in that i deem you an ill husband and am glad to have you therein my companion how now my lord you desire to know wherefore i sent for youist possible the spells of france should juggle men into such strange mysteries as far as i see all the good our english have got by the late voyage is but merely a fit or two o the face but they are shrewd ones for when they hold em you would swear directly their very noses had been counsellors to pepin or clotharius they keep state so death my lord their clothes are after such a pagan cut too that sure theyve worn out christendom   how now what news sir thomas lovell what ist for im glad tis there now i would pray our monsieurs to think an english courtier may be wise and never see the louvre what a loss our ladies will have of these trim vanities well said lord sands your colts tooth is not cast yet sir thomas

nay you must not freeze two women placed together makes cold weather my lord sands you are one will keep em waking pray sit between these ladies well said my lord so now youre fairly seated gentlemen the penance lies on you if these fair ladies pass away frowning look out there some of ye how now what ist because they speak no english thus they prayd to tell your grace that having heard by fame of this so noble and so fair assembly this night to meet here they could do no less out of the great respect they bear to beauty but leave their flocks and under your fair conduct crave leave to view these ladies and entreat an hour of revels with em your grace i will my lord such a one they all confess there is indeed which they would have your grace find out and he will take it ant please your grace sir thomas bullens daughter the viscount rochfordone of her highness women my lord the horses your lordship sent for with all the care i had i saw well chosen ridden and furnished they were young and handsome and of the best breed in the north when they were ready to set out for london a man of my lord cardinals by commission and main power took em from me with this reason his master would be served before a subject if not before the king which stopped our mouths sir i fear he will indeed well let him have them he will have all i think good day to both your graces i left him

sufferance panging as soul and bodys severing so much the more must pity drop upon her verily i swear tis better to be lowly born and range with humble livers in content than to be perkd up in a

to hera noble troop of strangers for so they seem theyve left their barge and landed and hither make as great ambassadors from foreign princeswhither away so fast ill save you that labour sir alls now done but the ceremony of bringing back the prisoner you may guess quickly what ill tell you in a little the great duke came to the bar where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law the kings attorney on the contrary urged on the examinations proofs confessions of divers witnesses which the duke desired to have brought viva voce to his face at which appeard against him his surveyor sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car confessor to him with that devilmonk hopkins that made this mischief when he was brought again to the bar to hear his knell rung out his judgment he was stirrd with such an agony he sweat extremely and something spoke in choler ill and hasty but he fell to himself again and sweetly in all the rest showd a most noble patience sure he does not he never was so womanish the cause he may a little grieve at stay there sir and see the noble ruind man you speak of o this is full of pity sir it calls i fear too many curses on their beads that were the authors good angels keep it from us what may it be you do not doubt my faith sir let me have it i do not talk much yes but it held not for when the king once heard it out of anger he sent command to the lord mayor straight to stop the rumor and allay those tongues that durst disperse it tis the cardinal and merely to revenge him on the emperor for not bestowing on him at his asking the archbishopric of toledo this is purposed tis woful we are too open here to argue this lets think in private more youre well met once again you come to take your stand here and behold the lady anne pass from her coronation tis very true but that time offerd sorrow this general joy yes tis the list of those that claim their offices this day by custom of the coronation the duke of suffolk is the first and claims to be highsteward next the duke of norfolk he to be earl marshal you may read the rest that i can tell you too the archbishop of canterbury accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers of his order held a late court at dunstable six miles off from ampthill where the princess lay to which she was often cited by them but appeard not and to be short for not appearance and the kings late scruple by the main assent of all these learned men she was divorced and the late marriage made of none effect since which she was removed to kimbolton where she remains now sick marquess dorset and that the earl of surrey with the rod tis the same highsteward yes they that bear the cloth of honour over her are four barons of the cinqueports it is and all the rest are countesses no more of that how was it sir you must no more call it yorkplace thats past for since the cardinal fell that titles lost tis now the kings and calld whitehallo god save ye even to the hall to hear what shall become of the great duke of buckingham yes indeed was i pray speak what has happend yes truly is he and condemnd upont so are a number more the same all these accused him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but indeed he could not and so his peers upon this evidence have found him guilty of high treason much he spoke and learnedly for life but all was either pitied in him or forgotten tis likely by all conjectures first kildares attainder then deputy of ireland who removed earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too lest he should help his father at his return no doubt he will requite it this is noted and generally whoever the king favours the cardinal instantly will find employment and far enough from court too lets stand close and behold him i am confident you shall sir did you not of late days hear a buzzing of a separation between the king and katharine i think you have hit the mark but ist not cruel that she should feel the smart of this the cardinal will have his will and she must fall ant please your grace the two great cardinals wait in the presence they willd me say so madam tis well the citizens i am sure have shown at full their royal minds as let em have their rights they are ever forward in celebration of this day with shows pageants and sights of honour never greater nor ill assure you better taken sir may i be bold to ask at what that contains that paper in your hand a royal train believe me these i know whos that that bears the sceptre god save you sir where have you been broiling at length her grace rose and with modest paces came to the altar where she kneeld and saintlike cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayd devoutly then rose again and bowd her to the people when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen as holy oil edward confessors crown the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems laid nobly on her which performd the choir with all the choicest music of the kingdom together sung te deum so she parted and with the same full state paced back again to yorkplace where the feast is held i know it but tis so lately alterd that the old name is fresh about me who may that be i pray you yes without all doubt come gentlemen ye shall go my way which is to the court and there ye shall be my guests something i can command as i walk thither ill tell ye more within                 come back what mean youwere you there is he found guilty i am sorry fort but pray how passd it that was he that fed him with his prophecies after all this how did he bear himself i do not think he fears death certainly the cardinal is the end of this that trick of state was a deep envious one all the commons hate him perniciously and o my conscience wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham the mirror of all courtesy if the duke be guiltless tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling of an ensuing evil if it fall greater than this this secret is so weighty twill require a strong faith to conceal it but that slander sir is found a truth now for it grows again fresher than eer it was and held for certain the king will venture at it either the cardinal or some about him near have out of malice to the good queen possessd him with a scruple that will undo her to confirm this too cardinal campeius is arrived and lately as all think for this business so are you tis all my business at our last encounter the duke of buckingham came from his trial i thank you sir had i not known those customs i should have been beholding to your paper but i beseech you whats become of katharine the princess dowager how goes her business alas good lady   the trumpets sound stand close the queen is coming      a lively flourish of trumpets  then two judges  lord chancellor with the purse and mace before him  choristers singing    mayor of london bearing the mace then garter in his coat of arms and on his head a gilt copper crown  marquess dorset bearing a sceptre of gold on his head a demicoronal of gold with him surrey bearing the rod of silver with the dove crowned with an earls coronet collars of ss  suffolk in his robe of estate his coronet on his head bearing a long white wand as highsteward with him norfolk with the rod of marshalship a coronet on his head collars of ss  a canopy borne by four of the cinqueports under it queen anne in her robe in her hair richly adorned with pearl crowned on each side her the bishops of london and winchester  the old duchess of norfolk in a coronal of gold wrought with flowers bearing queen annes train  certain ladies or countesses with plain circlets of gold without flowers a bold brave gentleman that should be the duke of suffolk and that my lord of norfolk heaven bless thee   thou hast the sweetest face i ever lookd on sir as i have a soul she is an angel our king has all the indies in his arms and more and richer when he strains that lady i cannot blame his conscience those men are happy and so are all are near her i take it she that carries up the train is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk their coronets say so these are stars indeed and sometimes falling ones you saw the ceremony good sir speak it to us but what followd what two reverend bishops were those that went on each side of the queen he of winchester is held no great good lover of the archbishops the virtuous cranmer he will deserve moreprepare there the duke is coming see the barge be ready and fit it with such furniture as suits the greatness of his personhow is the king employd no his conscience has crept too near another lady pray god he do hell never know himself else and free us from his slavery for me my lords i love him not nor fear him theres my creed as i am made without him so ill stand if the king please his curses and his blessings touch me alike theyre breath i not believe in i knew him and i know him so i leave him to him that made him proud the pope how sad he looks sure he is much afflicted aside to norfolk             not to speak of i would not be so sick though for his place but this cannot continue aside to norfolk          i another which of the peers have uncontemnd gone by him or at least strangely neglected when did he regard the stamp of nobleness in any person out of himself most strangely the cardinals letters to the pope miscarried and came to the eye o the king wherein was read how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness to stay the judgment o the divorce for if it did take place i do quoth he perceive my king is tangled in affection to a creature of the queens lady anne bullen believe it may you be happy in your wish my lord for i profess you have it my amen tot theres order given for her coronation marry this is yet but young and may be left to some ears unrecounted but my lords she is a gallant creature and complete in mind and feature i persuade me from her will fall some blessing to this land which shall in it be memorised no no there be moe wasps that buzz about his nose will make this sting the sooner cardinal campeius is stoln away to rome hath taen no leave has left the cause o the king unhandled and is posted as the agent of our cardinal to second all his plot i do assure you the king cried ha at this he is returnd in his opinions which have satisfied the king for his divorce together with all famous colleges almost in christendom shortly i believe his second marriage shall be publishd and her coronation katharine no more shall be calld queen but princess dowager and widow to prince arthur he has and we shall see him for it an archbishop tis so the cardinal may be he hears the king does whet his anger to him the king the king who dare cross em bearing the kings will from his mouth expressly then that without the knowledge either of king or council when you went ambassador to the emperor you made bold to carry into flanders the great seal that out of mere ambition you have caused your holy hat to be stampd on the kings coin lord cardinal the kings further pleasure is because all those things you have done of late by your power legatine within this kingdom fall into the compass of a praemunire that therefore such a writ be sued against you to forfeit all your goods lands tenements chattels and whatsoever and to be out of the kings protection this is my

forward as a man sorely tainted to his answer he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill he could not sit his mule at last with easy roads he came to leicester lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot with all his covent honourably received him to whom he gave these words o father abbot an old man broken with the storms of state is come to lay his weary bones among ye give him a little earth for charity so went to bed where eagerly his sickness pursued him still and three nights after this about the hour of eight which he himself foretold should be his last full of repentance continual meditations tears and sorrows he gave his honours to the world again his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace noble madam mens evil manners live in brass their virtues we write in water may it please your highness to hear me speak his good now this cardinal though from an humble stock undoubtedly was fashiond to much honour from his cradle he was a scholar and a ripe and good one exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading lofty and sour to them that loved him not but to those men that sought him sweet as summer and though he were unsatisfied in getting which was a sin yet in bestowing madam he was most princely ever witness for him those twins of learning that he raised in you ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him unwilling to outlive the good that did it the other though unfinishd yet so famous so excellent in art and still so rising that christendom shall ever speak his virtue his overthrow heapd happiness upon him for then and not till then he felt himself and found the blessedness of being little and to add greater honours to his age than man could give him he died fearing god she is asleep good wench lets sit down quiet for fear we wake her softly gentle patience madam we are here none madam i am most joyful madam such good dreams possess your fancy she is going wench pray pray you are to blame knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness to use so rude behavior go to kneelvery well my liege so please your highness the question did at first so stagger me bearing a state of mighty moment int and consequence of dread that i committed the daringst counsel which i had to doubt and did entreat your highness to this course which you are running herei am joyful to meet the least occasion that may give me remembrance of my fatherinlaw the duke to be revenged on him sir i should be glad to hear such news as this once every hour how came his practises to light o how how has the king this will this work would he had now all my joy trace the conjunction but will the king digest this letter of the cardinals the lord forbid sharp enough lord for thy justice i would twere something that would fret the string the mastercord ons heart aside  the lord increase this business the king that gave it thou art a proud traitor priest thy ambition thou scarlet sin robbd this bewailing land of noble buckingham my fatherinlaw the heads of all thy brother cardinals with thee and all thy best parts bound together weighd not a hair of his plague of your policy you sent me deputy for ireland far from his succor from the king from all that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him whilst your great goodness out of holy pity absolved him with an axe by my soul your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel my sword i the lifeblood of thee else my lords can ye endure to hear this arrogance and from this fellow if we live thus tamely to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet farewell nobility let his grace go forward and dare us with his cap like larks yes that goodness of gleaning all the lands wealth into one into your own hands cardinal by extortion the goodness of your intercepted packets you writ to the pope against the king your goodness since you provoke me shall be most notorious my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble as you respect the common good the state of our despised nobility our issues who if he live will scarce be gentlemen produce the grand sum of his sins the articles collected from his life ill startle you worse than the scaring bell when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal this cannot save you i thank my memory i yet remember some of these articles and out they shall now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal youll show a little honesty i had rather want those than my head have at you first that without the kings assent or knowledge you wrought to be a legate by which power you maimd the jurisdiction of all bishops item you sent a large commission to gregory de cassado to conclude without the kings will or the states allowance a league between his highness and ferrara then that you have sent innumerable substance by what means got i leave to your own conscience to furnish rome and to prepare the ways you have for dignities to the mere undoing of all the kingdom many more there are which since they are of you and odious i will not taint my mouth with i forgive him tis no counterfeit may it please your graceto his own hand ins bedchamber presently he did unseal them and the first he viewd he did it with a serious mind a heed was in his countenance you he bade attend him here this morning i think by this he is i have no power to speak sir how does your grace i am glad your grace has made that right use of it the heaviest and the worst is your displeasure with the king the next is that sir thomas more is chosen lord chancellor in your place that cranmer is returnd with welcome installd lord archbishop of canterbury last that the lady anne whom the king hath in secrecy long married this day was viewd in open as his queen going to chapel and the voice is now only about her coronation o my lord must i then leave you must i needs forego so good so noble and so true a master bear witness all that have not hearts of iron with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord the king shall have my service but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours good sir have patience please your honours the chief cause concerns his grace of canterbury yes my lord of winchester you are a little by your good favour too sharp men so noble however faulty yet should find respect for what they have been tis a cruelty to load a falling man why my lord not sound would you were half so honest mens prayers then would seek you not their fears do remember your bold life too and i my mind gave me in seeking tales and informations against this man whose honesty the devil and his disciples only envy at ye blew the fire that burns ye now have at yeamong the crowd i the abbey where a finger could not be wedged in more i am stifled with the mere rankness of their joy that i did well worth the seeing as well as i am able the rich stream of lords and ladies having brought the queen to a prepared place in the choir fell off a distance from her while her grace sat down to rest awhile some half an hour or so in a rich chair of state opposing freely the beauty of her person to the people believe me sir she is the goodliest woman that ever lay by man which when the people had the full view of such a noise arose as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks doublets i thinkflew up and had their faces been loose this day they had been lost such joy i never saw before greatbellied women that had not half a week to go like rams in the old time of war would shake the press and make em reel before em no man living could say this is my wife there all were woven so strangely in one piece stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester newly preferrd from the kings secretary the other london all the land knows that however yet there is no great breach when it comes cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him thomas cromwell a man in much esteem with the king and truly a worthy friend the king has made him master o the jewel house and one already of the privy councilyou may command us sirdo you note how much her grace is alterd on the sudden how long her face is drawn how pale she looks and of an earthy cold mark her eyes heaven comfort her no madamant like your grace i

most willing madam by heaven i will or let me lose the fashion of a manit hath strucksir i have brought my lord the archbishop as you commanded me ay my good lord he attends your highness pleasureaside i am fearful wherefore frowns he thus tis his aspect of terror alls not well kneeling              it is my duty to attend your highness pleasure kneeling i humbly thank your highness and am right glad to catch this good occasion most throughly to be winnowd where my chaff and corn shall fly asunder for i know theres none stands under more calumnious tongues than i myself poor man most dread liege the good i stand on is my truth and honesty if they shall fail i with mine enemies will triumph oer my person which i weigh not being of those virtues vacant i fear nothing what can be said against me god and your majesty protect mine innocence or i fall into the trap is laid for me i hope i am not too late and yet the gentleman that was sent to me from the council prayd me to make great haste all fast what means this ho who waits there sure you know me why so asidetis butts the kings physician as he passd along how earnestly he cast his eyes upon me pray heaven he sound not my disgrace for certain this is of purpose laid by some that hate me god turn their hearts i never sought their malice to quench mine honour they would shame to make me wait else at door a fellowcounsellor mong boys grooms and lackeys but their pleasures must be fulfilld and i attend with patience my good lords hitherto in all the progress both of my life and office i have labourd and with no little study that my teaching and the strong course of my authority might go one way and safely and the end was ever to do well nor is there living i speak it with a single heart my lords a man that more detests more stirs against both in his private conscience and his place defacers of a public peace than i do pray heaven the king may never find a heart with less allegiance in it men that make envy and crooked malice nourishment dare bite the best i do beseech your lordships that in this case of justice my accusers be what they will may stand forth face to face and freely urge against me ah my good lord of winchester i thank you you are always my good friend if your will pass i shall both find your lordship judge and juror you are so merciful i see your end tis my undoing love and meekness lord become a churchman better than ambition win straying souls with modesty again cast none away that i shall clear myself lay all the weight ye can upon my patience i make as little doubt as you do conscience in doing daily wrongs i could say more but reverence to your calling makes me modest is there no other way of mercy but i must needs to the tower my lords for me must i go like a traitor thither stay good my lords i have a little yet to say look there my lords by virtue of that ring i take my cause out of the gripes of cruel men and give it to a most noble judge the king my master the greatest monarch now alive may glory in such an honour how may i deserve it that am a poor and humble subject to you and let heaven witness how dear i hold this confirmation kneeling and to your royal grace and the good queen my noble partners and myself thus pray all comfort joy in this most gracious lady heaven ever laid up to make parents happy may hourly fall upon ye
