worlds debate how you delight my lords i know not i but i protest i love to hear him lie and i will use him for my minstrelsy a letter from the magnificent armado will you hear this letter with attention reads  great deputy the welkins vicegerent and sole dominator of navarre my souls earths god and bodys fostering patron reads  so it is peace no words reads  so it is besieged with sablecoloured melancholy i did commend the blackoppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy healthgiving air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to walk the time when about the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper so much for the time when now for the ground which which i mean i walked upon it is ycleped thy park then for the place where where i mean i did encounter that obscene and preposterous event that draweth from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest but to the place where it standeth northnortheast and by east from the west corner of thy curious knotted garden there did i see that lowspirited swain that base minnow of thy mirth reads  that unlettered smallknowing soul reads  that shallow vassal reads  which as i remember hight costard reads  sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon which witho withbut with this i passion to say wherewith reads  with a child of our grandmother eve a female or for thy more sweet understanding a woman him i as my everesteemed duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment by thy sweet graces officer anthony dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and estimation reads  for jaquenettaso is the weaker vessel called which i

intimate the payment of a hundred thousand crowns being but the one half of an entire sum disbursed by my father in his wars but say that he or we as neither have received that sum yet there remains unpaid a hundred thousand more in surety of the which one part of aquitaine is bound to us although not valued to the moneys worth if then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied we will give up our right in aquitaine and hold fair friendship with his majesty but that it seems he little purposeth for here he doth demand to have repaid a hundred thousand crowns and not demands on payment of a hundred thousand crowns to have his title live in aquitaine which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than aquitaine so gelded as it is dear princess were not his requests so far from reasons yielding your fair self should make a yielding gainst some reason in my breast and go well satisfied to france again i do protest i never heard

letters madam showd much more than jest but what to me my love but what to me a wife o shall i say i thank you gentle wife ill serve thee true and faithfully till then the worthy knight of troy doni can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years space by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest what is the end of study let me know things hid and barrd you mean from common sense come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thusto study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if studys gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will neer say no why all delights are vain but that most vain which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heavens glorious sun that will not be deepsearchd with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heavens lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name the spring is near when green geese are abreeding fit in his place and time something then in rhyme well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing why should i joy in any abortive birth at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in mays newfangled mirth but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb oer the house to unlock the little gate no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say yet confident ill keep what i have swore and bide the penance of each three years day give me the paper let me read the same and to the strictst decrees ill write my name reads  item that no woman shall come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimed lets see the penalty   on pain of losing her tongue who devised this penalty sweet lord and why a dangerous law against gentility   item if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise this article my liege yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french kings daughter with yourself to speak a maid of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain or vainly comes the admired princess hither so study evermore is overshot while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should and when it hath the thing it hunteth most tis won as towns with fire so won so lost necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years space for every man with his affects is born not by might masterd but by special grace if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity so to the laws at large i write my name   and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame suggestions are to other as to me but i believe although i seem so loath i am the last that will last keep his oath but is there no quick recreation granted armado is a most illustrious wight a man of firenew words fashions own knight this fellow what wouldst this is he how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words to hear or forbear laughing well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness in what manner for the following sir as we would hear an oracle this is not so well as i looked for but the best that ever i heard ill lay my head to any good mans hat these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn sirrah come on did not i dance with you in brabant once i know you did you

gone sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace as true we are as flesh and blood can be the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of inde at the first opening of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eaglesighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the culld sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a sellers praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a witherd hermit fivescore winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if newborn and gives the crutch the cradles infancy o tis the sun that maketh all things shine is ebony like her o wood divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my ladys brows be deckd it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be washd away ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn tis more than need have at you then affections men at arms consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you have vowd to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of studys excellence without the beauty of a womans face   why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and longduring action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller now for not looking on a womans face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is any author in the world teaches such beauty as a womans eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beautys tutors have enrichd you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a ladys eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lovers ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stoppd loves feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockld snails loves tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollos lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temperd with loves sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in ought proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdoms sake a word that all men love or for loves sake a word that loves all men or for mens sake the authors of these women or womens sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity advance your standards and upon them lords pellmell down with them but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them first from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them such as the shortness of the time can shape for revels dances masks and merry hours forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers allons allons sowd cockle reapd no corn and justice always whirls in equal measure light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn if so our copper buys no better treasure   loves labours lost aside to moth  their eyes villain their eyes aside to moth  once to behold rogue is this your perfectness be gone you rogue nothing but peace and gentle visitation tell her we measure them by weary steps we number nothing that we spend for you our duty is so rich so infinite that we may do it still without accompt vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face that we like savages may worship it whitehanded mistress one sweet word with thee nay then two treys and if you grow so nice metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice theres halfadozen sweets one word in secret thou grievest my gall therefore meet by heaven all drybeaten with pure scoff this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease and utters it again when god doth please he is wits pedler and retails his wares at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs and we that sell by gross the lord doth know have not the grace to grace it with such show this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve had he been adam he had tempted eve a can carve too and lisp why this is he that kissd his hand away in courtesy this is the ape of form monsieur the nice that when he plays at tables chides the dice in honourable terms nay he can sing a mean most meanly and in ushering mend him who can the ladies call him sweet the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet this is the flower that smiles on every one to show his teeth as white as whales bone and consciences that will not die in debt pay him the due of honeytongued boyet see where it comes behavior what wert thou till this madman showd thee and what art thou now this jest is dry to me fair gentle sweet your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet with eyes best seeing heavens fiery eye by light we lose light your capacity is of that nature that to your huge store wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor i am a fool and full of poverty o i am yours and all that i

understand you not my griefs are double we have received your letters full of love your favours the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as

worldwithoutend bargain in no no my lord your grace is perjured much full of dear guiltiness and therefore this if for my love as there is no such cause you will do aught this shall you do for me your

reckoning if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love but that it bear this trial and last love then at the expiration of the year come challenge me challenge me by these deserts and by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine and till that instant shut my woeful

lord my lady to the manner of the days in courtesy gives undeserving praise we four indeed confronted were with four in russian habit here they stayd an hour and talkd apace and in that hour my lord they did not bless us with one happy word i dare not call them fools but this i think when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink this proves you wise and rich for in my eye but that you take what doth to you belong it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue all the fool mine which of the vizards was it that you wore there then that vizard that superfluous case that hid the worse and showd the better face help hold his brows hell swoon why look you pale seasick i think coming from muscovy sans sans i pray you it is not so for how can this be true that you stand forfeit being those that sue nor shall not if i do as i intend madam he swore that he did hold me dear as precious eyesight and did value me above this world adding thereto moreover that he would wed me or else die my lover by heaven you did and to confirm it plain you gave me this but take it sir again we did not quote them so oft have i heard of you my lord biron before i saw you and the worlds large tongue

brain and therewithal to win me if you please without the which i am not to be won you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches and your task shall be with all the fierce endeavor of your wit to enforce the pained impotent to smile why thats the way to choke a gibing spirit whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools a jests prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him that makes it then if sickly ears deafd with the clamours of their own dear groans will hear your idle scorns continue then and i will have you and that fault withal but if they will not throw away that spirit and i shall find you empty of that fault right joyful of your
