call they this at hand needs must i like it well i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs as a longparted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favours with my royal hands feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavygaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellions arms discomfortable cousin knowst thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath revelld in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressd to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right   welcome my lordhow far off lies your power but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest is not the kings name twenty thousand names arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground ye favourites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here mine ear is open and my heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold say is my kingdom lost why twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolingbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god well serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin and decay the worst is death and death will have his day too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot what is become of bushy where is green that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps if we prevail their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke o villains vipers damnd without redemption dogs easily won to fawn on any man snakes in my heartblood warmd that sting my heart three judases each one thrice worse than judas would they make peace terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this offence no matter where of comfort no man speak lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth lets choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground our lands our lives and all are bolingbrokes and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for gods sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd all murderd for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feard and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humourd thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee   because we thought ourself thy lawful king and if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre unless he do profane steal or usurp and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown tell bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons shall ill become the flower of englands face change the complexion of her maidpale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures grass with faithful english blood northumberland say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplishd without contradiction with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends we do debase ourselves cousin do we not   to look so poorly and to speak so fair shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die what must the king do now must he submit the king shall do it must he be deposed the king shall be contented must he lose the name of king o gods name let it go ill give my jewels for a set of beads my gorgeous palace for a hermitage my gay apparel for an almsmans gown my figured goblets for a dish of wood my sceptre for a palmers walking staff my subjects for a pair of carved saints and my large kingdom for a little grave a little little grave an obscure grave or ill be buried in the kings highway some way of common trade where subjects feet may hourly trample on their sovereigns head for on my heart they tread now whilst i live and buried once why not upon my head aumerle thou weepst my tenderhearted cousin well make foul weather with despised tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laidthere lies two kinsmen diggd their graves with weeping eyes would not this ill do well well well i see i talk but idly and you laugh at me most mighty prince my lord northumberland what says king bolingbroke will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard

must i do so and must i ravel out my weavedup folly gentle northumberland if thy offences were upon record would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst there shouldst thou find one heinous article containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath markd with a blot damnd in the book of heaven nay all of you that stand and look upon whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity yet you pilates have here deliverd me to my sour cross and water cannot wash away your sin mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself i find myself a traitor with the rest for i have given here my souls consent to undeck the pompous body of a king made glory base and sovereignty a slave proud majesty a subject state a peasant no lord of thine thou haught insulting man nor no mans lord i have no name no title no not that name was given me at the font but tis usurpd alack the heavy day that i have worn so many winters out and know not now what name to call myself o that i were a mockery king of snow standing before the sun of bolingbroke to melt myself away in waterdrops good king great king and yet not greatly good an if my word be sterling yet in england let it command a mirror hither straight that it may show me what a face i have since it is bankrupt of his majesty fiend thou tormentst me ere i come to hell they shall be satisfied ill read enough when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ and thats myself   give me the glass and therein will i read no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine and made no deeper wounds o flattering glass like to my followers in prosperity thou dost beguile me was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men was this the face that like the sun did make beholders wink was this the face that faced so many follies and was at last outfaced by bolingbroke a brittle glory shineth in this face as brittle as the glory is the face   for there it is crackd in a hundred shivers mark silent king the moral of this sport how soon my sorrow hath destroyd my face say that again the shadow of my sorrow ha lets see tis very true my grief lies all within and these external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul there lies the substance and i thank thee king for thy great bounty that not only givest me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause ill beg one boon and then be gone and trouble you no more shall i obtain it fair cousin i am greater than a king for when i was a king my flatterers were then but subjects being now a subject i have a king here to my flatterer being so great i have no need to beg and shall i have then give me leave to go whither you will so i were from your sights o good convey conveyers are you all that rise thus nimbly by a true kings fall join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shows us but this i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house our holy lives must win a new worlds crown which our profane hours here have stricken down a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts i had been still a happy king of men good sometime queen prepare thee hence for france think i am dead and that even here thou takest as from my deathbed thy last living leave in winters tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds for why the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out and some will mourn in ashes some coalblack for the deposing of a rightful king northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shalt break into corruption thou shalt think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all and he shall think that thou which knowst the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being neer so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne the love of wicked men converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserved death doubly divorced bad men you violate a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me and then betwixt me and my married wife let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me and yet not so for with a kiss twas made part us northumberland i toward the north where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp she came adorned hither like sweet may sent back like hallowmas or shortst of day ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart so two together weeping make one woe weep thou for me in france i for thee here better far off than near be neer the near go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans twice for one step ill groan the way being short and piece the way out with a heavy heart come come in wooing sorrow lets be brief since wedding it there is such length in grief one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart we make woe wanton with this fond delay once more adieu the rest let sorrow say rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend how went he under him so proud that bolingbroke was on his back that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him would he not stumble would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee since thou created to be awed by man wast born to bear i was not made a horse and yet i bear a burthen like an ass spurrd galld and tired by jouncing bolingbroke if thou love me tis time thou wert away taste of it first as thou art wont to do the devil take henry of lancaster and thee patience is stale and i am weary of it how now what means death in this rude assault villain thy own hand yields thy deaths instrument   go thou and fill another room in hell   that hand shall burn in neverquenching fire that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand hath with the kings blood staind the kings own land mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to diei have my liege as near as i could sift him on that argument on some apparent danger seen in him aimd at your highness no inveterate malice to be a makepeace shall become my age throw down my son the duke of norfolks gage when harry when obedience bids i should not bid again gods is the quarrel for gods substitute his deputy anointed in his sight hath caused his death the which if wrongfully let heaven revenge for i may never lift an angry arm against his minister to god the widows champion and defence sister farewell i must to coventry as much good stay with thee as go with me god in thy good cause make thee prosperous be swift like lightning in the execution and let thy blows doubly redoubled fall like amazing thunder on the casque of thy adverse pernicious enemy rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my sons exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oildried lamp and timebewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son but not a minute king that thou canst give shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou canst help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour you urged me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroyd alas i lookd when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou returnst no greeting to thy friends thy grief is but thy absence for a time what is six winters they are quickly gone call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return will the king come that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth o but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain he that no more must say is listend more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose more are mens ends markd than their lives before the setting sun and music at the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than things long past though richard my lifes counsel would not hear my deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last for violent fires soon burn out themselves small showers last long but sudden storms are short he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder light vanity insatiate cormorant consuming means soon preys upon itself this royal throne of kings this scepterd isle this earth of majesty this seat of mars this other eden demiparadise this fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war this happy breed of men this little world this precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happier lands this blessed plot this earth this realm this england this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings feard by their breed and famous by their birth renowned for their deeds as far from home for christian service and true chivalry as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry of the worlds ransom blessed marys son this land of such dear souls this dear dear land dear for her reputation through the world is now leased out i die pronouncing it like to a tenement or pelting farm england bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of watery neptune is now bound in with shame with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds that england that was wont to conquer others hath made a shameful conquest of itself ah would the scandal vanish with my life how happy then were my ensuing death o how that name befits my composition old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old within me grief hath kept a tedious fast and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt for sleeping england long time have i watchd watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt the pleasure that some fathers feed upon is my strict fast i mean my childrens looks and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones no misery makes sport to mock itself since thou dost seek to kill my name in me i mock my name great king to flatter thee no no men living flatter those that die o no thou diest though i the sicker be now he that made me knows i see thee ill ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land wherein thou liest in reputation sick and thou too careless patient as thou art commitst thy anointed body to the cure of those physicians that first wounded thee a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown whose compass is no bigger than thy head and yet incaged in so small a verge the waste is no whit lesser than thy land o had thy grandsire with a prophets eye seen how his sons son should destroy his sons from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame deposing thee before thou wert possessd which art possessd now to depose thyself why cousin wert thou regent of the world it were a shame to let this land by lease but for thy world enjoying but this land is it not more than shame to shame it so landlord of england art thou now not king thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou o spare me not my brother edwards son for that i was his father edwards son that blood already like the pelican hast thou tappd out and drunkenly caroused my brother gloucester plain wellmeaning soul whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls may be a precedent and witness good that thou respectst not spilling edwards blood join with the present sickness that i have and thy unkindness be like crooked age to crop at once a too long witherd flower live in thy shame but die not shame with thee these words hereafter thy tormentors be convey me to my bed then to my grave love they to live that love and honour havetell me moreover hast thou sounded him if he appeal the duke on ancient malice or worthily as a good subject should on some known ground of treachery in him mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir as he is but my fathers brothers son now by my sceptres awe i make a vow such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood should nothing privilege him nor partialize the unstooping firmness of my upright soul he is our subject mowbray so art thou free speech and fearless i to thee allow it boots thee not to be compassionate after our sentence plaining comes too late we did observe cousin aumerle how far brought you high hereford on his way now put it god in the physicians mind to help him to his grave immediately the lining of his coffers shall make coats to deck our soldiers for these irish wars come gentlemen lets all go visit him pray god we may make haste and come too late should dying men flatter with those that live thou chidest me well proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom this ague fit of fear is overblown an easy task it is to win our own say scroop where lies our uncle with his power speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour thou hast said enough beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth   of that sweet way i was in to despair what say you now what comfort have we now by heaven ill hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort any more go to flint castle there ill pine away a king woes slave shall kingly woe obey that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for i have none let no man speak again to alter this for counsel is but vain he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue discharge my followers let them hence away from richards night to bolingbrokes fair day then i must not say no i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet ill hammer it out my brain ill prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of stillbreeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humours like the people of this world for no thought is contented the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixd with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus come little ones and then again it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needles eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortunes slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one person many people and none contented sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kingd again and by and by think that i am unkingd by bolingbroke and straight am nothing but whateer i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing music do i hear   ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept so is it in the music of mens lives and here have i the daintiness of ear to cheque time broke in a disorderd string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numbering clock my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dials point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours but my time runs posting on in bolingbrokes proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack o the clock this music mads me let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad yet blessing on his heart that gives it me for tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this allhating world thanks noble peer the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear what art thou and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune livemany years of happy days befal my gracious sovereign my most loving liege first heaven be the record to my speech in the devotion of a subjects love tendering the precious safety of my prince and free from other misbegotten hate come i appellant to this princely presence now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee and mark my greeting well for what i speak my body shall make good upon this earth or my divine soul answer it in heaven thou art a traitor and a miscreant too good to be so and too bad to live since the more fair and crystal is the sky the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly once more the more to aggravate the note with a foul traitors name stuff i thy throat and wish so please my sovereign ere i move what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast or

the newseach day still better others happiness until the heavens envying earths good hap add an immortal title to your crown let not my cold words here accuse my zeal tis not the trial of a womans war the bitter clamour of two eager tongues can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain the blood is hot that must be coold for this yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be hushd and nought at all to say first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and spurs to my free speech which else would post until it had returnd these terms of treason doubled down his throat setting aside his high bloods royalty and let him be no kinsman to my liege i do defy him and i spit at him call him a slanderous coward and a villain which to maintain i would allow him odds and meet him were i tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the alps or any other ground inhabitable where ever englishman durst set his foot mean time let this defend my loyalty by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie o let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf till i have told this slander of his blood how god and good men hate so foul a liar then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart through the false passage of thy throat thou liest three parts of that receipt i had for calais disbursed i duly to his highness soldiers the other part reserved i by consent for that my sovereign liege was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account since last i went to france to fetch his queen now swallow down that lie for gloucesters death i slew him not but to my own disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case for you my noble lord of lancaster the honourable father to my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it and exactly beggd your graces pardon and i hope i had it this is my fault as for the rest appealld it issues from the rancour of a villain a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitors foot to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom in haste whereof most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot my life thou shalt command but not my shame the one my duty owes but my fair name despite of death that lives upon my grave to dark dishonours use thou shalt not have i am disgraced impeachd and baffled here pierced to the soul with slanders venomd spear the which no balm can cure but his heartblood which breathed this poison yea but not change his spots take but my shame and i resign my gage my dear dear lord the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation that away men are but gilded loam or painted clay a jewel in a tentimesbarrdup chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast mine honour is my life both grow in one take honour from me and my life is done then dear my liege mine honour let me try in that i live and for that will i die my name is thomas mowbray duke of norfolk who hither come engaged by my oath which god defend a knight should violate both to defend my loyalty and truth to god my king and my succeeding issue against the duke of hereford that appeals me and by the grace of god and this mine arm to prove him in defending of myself a traitor to my god my king and me and as i truly fight defend me heaven however god or fortune cast my lot there lives or dies true to king richards throne a loyal just and upright gentleman never did captive with a freer heart cast off his chains of bondage and embrace his golden uncontrolld enfranchisement more than my dancing soul doth celebrate this feast of battle with mine adversary most mighty liege and my companion peers take from my mouth the wish of happy years as gentle and as jocund as to jest go i to fight truth hath a quiet breast a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlookd for from your highness mouth a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deserved at your highness hands the language i have learnd these forty years my native english now i must forego and now my tongues use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony within my mouth you have engaold my tongue doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath then thus i turn me from my countrys light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night and i to keep all this no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banishd as from hence but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue farewell my liege now no way can i stray save back to england all the worlds my waypale trembling coward there i throw my gage disclaiming here the kindred of the king and lay aside my high bloods royalty which fear not reverence makes thee to except if guilty dread have left thee so much strength as to take up mine honours pawn then stoop by that and all the rites of knighthood else will i make good against thee arm to arm what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise look what i speak my life shall prove it true that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness soldiers the which he hath detaind for lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was surveyd by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucesters death suggest his soonbelieving adversaries and consequently like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood like sacrificing abels cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth to me for justice and rough chastisement and by the glorious worth of my descent this arm shall do it or this life be spent o god defend my soul from such deep sin shall i seem crestfalln in my fathers sight or with pale beggarfear impeach my height before this outdared dastard ere my tongue shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear the slavish motive of recanting fear and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace where shame doth harbour even in mowbrays face harry of hereford lancaster and derby am i who ready here do stand in arms to prove by gods grace and my bodys valour in lists on thomas mowbray duke of norfolk that he is a traitor foul and dangerous to god of heaven king richard and to me and as i truly fight defend me heaven lord marshal let me kiss my sovereigns hand and bow my knee before his majesty for mowbray and myself are like two men that vow a long and weary pilgrimage then let us take a ceremonious leave and loving farewell of our several friends o let no noble eye profane a tear for me if i be gored with mowbrays spear as confident as is the falcons flight against a bird do i with mowbray fight my loving lord i take my leave of you of you my noble cousin lord aumerle not sick although i have to do with death but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath lo as at english feasts so i regreet the daintiest last to make the end most sweet o thou the earthly author of my blood whose youthful spirit in me regenerate doth with a twofold vigour lift me up to reach at victory above my head add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers and with thy blessings steel my lances point that it may enter mowbrays waxen coat and furbish new the name of john a gaunt even in the lusty havior of his son mine innocency and saint george to thrive strong as a tower in hope i cry amen your will be done this must my comfort be sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment i swear norfolk so far as to mine enemy by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wanderd in the air banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banishd from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burthen of a guilty soul how long a time lies in one little word four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongues office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart joy absent grief is present for that time to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an inforced pilgrimage nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief then englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu my mother and my nurse that bears me yet whereer i wander boast of this i can though banishd yet a trueborn englishman how far is it my lord to berkeley now of much less value is my company than your good words but who comes here i thank thee gentle percy and be sure i count myself in nothing else

full three months since i did see him last if any plague hang over us tis he i would to god my lords he might be found inquire at london mongst the taverns there for there they say he daily doth frequent with unrestrained loose companions even such they say as stand in narrow lanes and beat our watch and rob our passengers which he young wanton and effeminate boy takes on the point of honour to support so dissolute a crew and what said the gallant as dissolute as desperate yet through both i see some sparks of better hope which elder years may happily bring forth but who comes here withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone   what is the matter with our cousin now intended or committed was this fault if on the first how heinous eer it be to win thy afterlove i pardon thee have thy desire villain ill make thee safe o heinous strong and bold conspiracy o loyal father of a treacherous son thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain from when this stream through muddy passages

mine enemy thou hast ever been high sparks of honour in thee have i seen exton i thank thee not for thou hast wrought a deed of slander with thy fatal hand upon my head and all this famous land they love not poison that do poison need nor do i thee though i did wish him dead i hate the murderer love him murdered the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour but neither my good word nor princely favour with cain go wander through shades of night and never show thy head by day nor light lords i protest my soul is full of woe that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow come mourn with me for that i do lament and put on sullen black incontinent ill make a voyage to the holy land to wash this blood off from my guilty hand march sadly after grace my mournings here in weeping

alive may i not light if i be traitor or unjustly fightwe were not born to sue but to command which since we cannot do to make you friends be ready as your lives shall answer it at coventry upon saint lamberts day there shall your swords and lances arbitrate the swelling difference of your settled hate since we can not atone you we shall see justice design the victors chivalry lord marshal command our officers at arms be ready to direct these home alarms o god o god that eer this tongue of mine that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man should take it off again with words of sooth o that i were as great as is my grief or lesser than my name or that i could forget what i have been or not remember what i must be now swellst thou proud heart ill give thee scope to beat since foes have scope to beat both thee and mealas the part i had in woodstocks blood doth more solicit me than your exclaims to stir against the butchers of his life but since correction lieth in those hands which made the fault that we cannot correct put we our quarrel to the will of heaven who when they see the hours ripe on earth will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity think not the king did banish thee but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime look what thy soul holds dear imagine it to lie that way thou gost not whence thou comest suppose the singing birds musicians the grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light come come my son ill bring thee on thy way had i thy youth and cause i would not stayfinds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur hath love in thy old blood no living fire edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one were as seven vials of his sacred blood or seven fair branches springing from one root some of those seven are dried by natures course some of those branches by the destinies cut but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester one vial full of edwards sacred blood one flourishing branch of his most royal root is crackd and all the precious liquor spilt is hackd down and his summer leaves all faded by envys hand and murders bloody axe ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb that metal that selfmould that fashiond thee made him a man and though thou livest and breathest yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent in some large measure to thy fathers death in that thou seest thy wretched brother die who was the model of thy fathers life call it not patience gaunt it is despair in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughterd thou showest the naked pathway to thy life teaching stern murder how to butcher thee that which in mean men we intitle patience is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts what shall i say to safeguard thine own life the best way is to venge my gloucesters death where then alas may i complain myself why then i will farewell old gaunt thou goest to coventry there to behold our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight o sit my husbands wrongs on herefords spear that it may enter butcher mowbrays breast or if misfortune miss the first career be mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom they may break his foaming coursers back and throw the rider headlong in the lists a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford farewell old gaunt thy sometimes brothers wife with her companion grief must end her life yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls not with the empty hollowness but weight i take my leave before i have begun for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done commend me to thy brother edmund york lo this is allnay yet depart not so though this be all do not so quickly go i shall remember more bid himah what with all good speed at plashy visit me alack and what shall good old york there see but empty lodgings and unfurnishd walls unpeopled offices untrodden stones and what hear there for welcome but my groans therefore commend me let him not come there to seek out sorrow that dwells every where desolate desolate will i hence and die the last leave of thee takes my weeping eyemy lord aumerle is harry hereford armd the duke of norfolk sprightfully and bold stays

  stay the king hath thrown his warder down my lord no leave take i for i will ride as far as land will let me by your sideyea at all points and longs to enter in why then the champions are prepared and stay for nothing but his majestys approach i brought high hereford if you call him so but to the next highway and there i left him faith none for me except the northeast wind which then blew bitterly against our faces awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear farewell and for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane the word that taught me craft to counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seemd buried in my sorrows grave marry would the word farewell have lengthend hours and added years to his short banishment he should have had a volume of farewells but since it would not he had none of me yea my lord how brooks your grace the air after your late tossing on the breaking seas he means my lord that we are too remiss whilst bolingbroke through our security grows strong and great in substance and in power comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale comfort my liege remember who you are is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead where is the duke my father with his power my father hath a power inquire of him and learn to make a body of a limb my liege one word no good my lord lets fight with gentle words till

my lord tis nothing i do beseech you pardon me i may not show it good mother be content it is no more than my poor life must answer god save your grace i do beseech your majesty to have some conference with your grace alone stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear remember as thou readst thy promise passd i do repent me read not my name there my heart is not confederate with my handwhat is thy name and wherefore comest thou hither before king richard in his royal lists against whom comest thou and whats thy quarrel speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven harry of hereford lancaster and derby receive thy lance and god defend the rightharry of hereford lancaster and derby stands here for god his sovereign and himself on pain to be found false and recreant to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray a traitor to his god his king and him and dares him to set forward to the fighthere standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk on pain to be found false and recreant both to defend himself and to approve henry of hereford lancaster and derby to god his sovereign and to him disloyal courageously and with a free desire attending but the signal to begincousin farewell what presence must not know from where you do remain let paper show i do beseech your grace to pardon me it is a matter of small consequence which for some reasons i would not have seen then give me leave that i may turn the key that no man enter till my tale be donewell he is gone and with him go these thoughts now for the rebels which stand out in ireland expedient manage must be made my liege ere further leisure yield them further means for their advantage and your highness loss god save your majesty and well met gentlemen i hope the king is not yet shippd for ireland that he our hope might have retired his power and driven into despair an enemys hope who strongly hath set footing in this land the banishd bolingbroke repeals himself and with uplifted arms is safe arrived at ravenspurgh ah madam tis too true and that is worse the lord northumberland his son young henry percy the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby with all their powerful friends are fled to him we have whereupon the earl of worcester hath broke his staff resignd his stewardship and all the household servants fled with him to bolingbroke here comes the duke of york besides our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle the earl of wiltshire is already there alas poor duke the task he undertakes is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry where one on his side fights thousands will fly farewell at once for once for all and ever my comfort is that heaven will take our souls and plague injustice with the pains of hellold john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord suddenly taken and hath sent post haste to entreat your majesty to visit him at ely house madam your majesty is too much sad you promised when you parted with the king to lay aside lifeharming heaviness and entertain a cheerful disposition each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows which shows like grief itself but is not so for sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears divides one thing entire to many objects like perspectives which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion eyed awry distinguish form so your sweet majesty looking awry upon your lords departure find shapes of grief more than himself to wail which lookd on as it is is nought but shadows of what it is not then thricegracious queen more than your lords departure weep not mores not seen or if it be tis with false sorrows eye which for things true weeps things imaginary tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady why have you not proclaimd northumberland and all the rest revolted faction traitors despair not madam the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland but none returns for us to levy power proportionable to the enemy is all unpossible wherein the king stands generally condemnd thither will i with you for little office the hateful commons will perform for us except like curs to tear us all to pieces will you go along with us thats as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke well we may meet again more welcome is the stroke of death to me than bolingbroke to england lords farewellamenvex not yourself nor strive not with your breath for all in vain comes counsel to his ear no it is stoppd with other flattering sounds as praises of whose taste the wise are fond lascivious metres to whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation where doth the world thrust forth a vanity so it be new theres no respect how vile that is not quickly buzzed into his ears then all too late comes counsel to be heard where will doth mutiny with wits regard direct not him whose way himself will choose tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose i do beseech your majesty impute his words to wayward sickliness and age in him he loves you on my life and holds you dear as harry duke of hereford were he here be york the next that must be bankrupt so though death be poor it ends a mortal woe how long shall i be patient ah how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong not gloucesters death nor herefords banishment not gaunts rebukes nor englands private wrongs nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke about his marriage nor my own disgrace have ever made me sour my patient cheek or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face i am the last of noble edwards sons of whom thy father prince of wales was first in war was never lion raged more fierce in peace was never gentle lamb more mild than was that young and princely gentleman his face thou hast for even so lookd he accomplishd with the number of thy hours but when he frownd it was against the french and not against his friends his noble hand did will what he did spend and spent not that which his triumphant fathers hand had won his hands were guilty of no kindred blood but bloody with the enemies of his kin o richard york is too far gone with grief or else he never

will which tired majesty did make thee offer the resignation of thy state and crown to henry bolingbroke where did i leave then as i said the duke great bolingbroke mounted upon a hot and fiery steed which his aspiring rider seemd to know with slow but stately pace kept on his course whilst all tongues cried god save thee bolingbroke you would have thought the very windows spake so many greedy looks of young and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke whilst he from the one side to the other turning bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck bespake them thus i thank you countrymen and thus still doing thus he passd along as in a theatre the eyes of men after a wellgraced actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next thinking his prattle to be tedious even so or with much more contempt mens eyes did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home but dust was thrown upon his sacred head which with such gentle sorrow he shook off his face still combating with tears and smiles the badges of his grief and patience that had not god for some strong purpose steeld the hearts of men they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him but heaven hath a hand in these events to whose high will we bound our calm contents to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now whose state and honour i for aye allow aumerle that was but that is lost for being richards friend and madam you must call

lancaster hath spent well lords the duke of lancaster is dead richly in both if justice had her right nay speak thy mind and let him neer speak more that speaks thy words again to do thee harm now afore god tis shame such wrongs are borne in him a royal prince and many moe of noble blood in this declining land the king is not himself but basely led by flatterers and what they will inform merely in hate gainst any of us all that will the king severely prosecute gainst us our lives our children and our heirs wars have not wasted it for warrd he hath not but basely yielded upon compromise that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows more hath he spent in peace than they in wars reproach and dissolution hangeth over him his noble kinsman most degenerate king but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing yet see no shelter to avoid the storm we see the wind sit sore upon our sails and yet we strike not but securely perish not so even through the hollow eyes of death i spy life peering but i dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is then thus i have from port le blanc a bay in brittany received intelligence that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham that late broke from the duke of exeter his brother archbishop late of canterbury sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint all these well furnishd by the duke of bretagne with eight tall ships three thousand men of war are making hither with all due expedience and shortly mean to touch our northern shore perhaps they had ere this but that they stay the first departing of the king for ireland if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke imp out our drooping countrys broken wing redeem from broking pawn the blemishd crown wipe off the dust that hides our sceptres gilt and make high majesty look like itself away with me in post to ravenspurgh but if you faint as fearing to do so stay and be secret and myself will go believe me noble lord i am a stranger here in gloucestershire these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles and makes them wearisome and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar making the hard way sweet and delectable but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found in ross and willoughby wanting your company which i protest hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoyd by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short as mine hath done by sight of what i have your noble company it is my son young harry percy sent from my brother worcester whencesoever harry how fares your uncle why is he not with the queen what was his reason he was not so resolved when last we spake together have you forgot the duke of hereford boy then learn to know him now this is the duke how far is it to berkeley and what stir keeps good old york there with his men of war here come the lords of ross and willoughby bloody with spurring fieryred with haste it is my lord of berkeley as i guess the noble duke hath been too much abused the noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own and for the right of that we all have strongly sworn to give him aid and let him neer see joy that breaks that oath the news is very fair and good my lord richard not far from hence hath hid his head your grace mistakes only to be brief left i his title out o belike it is the bishop of carlisle the king of heaven forbid our lord the king should so with civil and uncivil arms be rushd upon thy thrice noble cousin harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand and by the honourable tomb he swears that stands upon your royal grandsires bones and by the royalties of both your bloods currents that spring from one most gracious head and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt and by the worth and honour of himself comprising all that may be sworn or said his coming hither hath no further scope than for his lineal royalties and to beg enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees which on thy royal party granted once his glittering arms he will commend to rust his barbed steeds to stables and his heart to faithful service of your majesty this swears he as he is a prince is just and as i am a gentleman i credit him my lord in the base court he doth attend to speak with you may it please you to come down sorrow and grief of heart makes him speak fondly like a frantic man yet he is come well have you argued sir and for your pains of capital treason we arrest you here my lord of westminster be it your charge to keep him safely till his day of trial may it please you lords to grant the commons suit no more but that you read these accusations and these grievous crimes committed by your person and your followers against the state and profit of this land that by confessing them the souls of men may deem that you are worthily deposed my lord dispatch read oer these articles my lord read oer this paper while the glass doth come the commons will not then be satisfied my lord the mind of bolingbroke is changed you must to pomfret not unto the tower and madam there is order taen for you with all swift speed you must away to france my guilt be on my head and there an end take leave and part for you must part forthwith that were some love but little policy first to thy sacred state wish i all happiness the next news is i have to london sent the heads of oxford salisbury blunt and kent the manner of their taking may appear at large discoursed in this paper hereand living too for now his son is duke my heart is great but it must break with silence eret be disburdend with a liberal tongue no good at all that i can do for him unless you call it good to pity him bereft and gelded of his patrimony the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm he hath not money for these irish wars his burthenous taxations notwithstanding but by the robbing of the banishd duke we see the very wreck that we must suffer and unavoided is the danger now for suffering so the causes of our wreck be confident to speak northumberland we three are but thyself and speaking so thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear your presence makes us rich most noble lord it stands your grace upon to do him rightbarely in title not in revenue tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford if it be so out with it boldly man quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him and daily new exactions are devised as blanks benevolences and i wot not what but what o gods name doth become of this the kings grown bankrupt like a broken man nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours hold out my horse and i will first be there and far surmounts our labour to attain it base men by his endowments are made greatthe commons hath he pilld with grievous taxes and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined for ancient quarrels and quite lost their heartsmy lord your son was gone before i came my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship today as i came by i called there but i shall grieve you to report the rest an hour before i came the duchess died why should we in the compass of a pale keep law and form and due proportion showing as in a model our firm estate when our seawalled garden the whole land is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up her fruittrees all upturned her hedges ruind her knots disorderd and her wholesome herbs swarming with caterpillars what are they dead what think you then the king shall be deposed these were his very words he didand thats the wavering commons for their love lies in their purses and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate if judgement lie in them then so do we because we ever have been near the king no i will to ireland to his majesty farewell if hearts presages be not vain we three here art that neer shall meet again i fear me never then set before my face the lord aumerle my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue scorns to unsay what once it hath deliverd in that dead time when gloucesters death was plotted i heard you say is not my arm of length that reacheth from the restful english court as far as calais to mine uncles head amongst much other talk that very time i heard you say that you had rather refuse the offer of an hundred thousand crowns than bolingbrokes return to england adding withal how blest this land would be in this your cousins deathi had thought my lord to have learnd his health of you no my good lord he hath forsook the court broken his staff of office and dispersed the household of the king no my good lord for that is not forgot which neer i did remember to my knowledge i never in my life did look on him my gracious lord i tender you my service such as it is being tender raw and young which elder days shall ripen and confirm to more approved service and desert there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees mannd with three hundred men as i have heard and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour none else of name and noble estimate the castle royally is mannd my lord against thy entrance yes my good lord it doth contain a king king richard lies within the limits of yon lime and stone and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman of holy reverence who i cannot learn aumerle thou liest his honour is as true in this appeal as thou art all unjust and that thou art so there i throw my gage to prove it on thee to the extremest point of mortal breathing seize it if thou darest my lord some two days since i saw the prince and told him of those triumphs held at oxford his answer was he would unto the stews and from the commonst creature pluck a glove and wear it as a favour and with that he would unhorse the lustiest challengerbecause your lordship was proclaimed traitor but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh to offer service to the duke of hereford and sent me over by berkeley to discover what power the duke of york had levied there then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh the grand conspirator abbot of westminster with clog of conscience and sour melancholy hath yielded up his body to the grave but here is carlisle living to abide thy kingly doom and sentence of his pridemy lord of hereford my message is to youmistake me not my lord tis not my meaning to raze one title of your honour out to you my lord i come what lord you will from the most gracious regent of this land the duke of york to know what pricks you on to take advantage of the absent time and fright our native peace with selfborn armstut tut grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle i am no traitors uncle and that word grace in an ungracious mouth is but profane why have those banishd and forbidden legs dared once to touch a dust of englands ground but then more why why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom frighting her palefaced villages with war and ostentation of despised arms comest thou because the anointed king is hence why foolish boy the king is left behind and in my loyal bosom lies his power were i but now the lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt thy father and myself rescued the black prince that young mars of men from

me you would tell the rest when weeping made you break the story off of our two cousins coming into london at that sad stop my lord where rude misgovernd hands from windows tops threw dust and rubbish on king richards head no matter then who see it i will be satisfied let me see the writing what should you fear tis nothing but some bond that he is enterd into for gay apparel gainst the triumph day peace foolish woman i will not peace what is the matter aumerle thy life answer bring me my boots i will unto the king hadst thou groand for him as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful but now i

or any of my kin and yet i love him within  my liege beware look to thyself thou hast a traitor in thy presence there not yet i thee beseech for ever will i walk upon my knees and never see day that the happy sees till thou give joy until thou bid me joy by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy nay do not say stand up say pardon first and afterwards stand up and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach pardon should be the first word of thy speech i never longd to hear a word till now say pardon king let pity teach thee how the word is short but not so short as sweet no word like pardon for kings mouths so meet i do not sue to stand pardon is all the suit i have in handmy lord of salisbury we have stayd ten days and hardly kept our countrymen together and yet we hear no tidings from the king therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell tis thought the king is dead we will not stay the baytrees in our country are all witherd and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven the palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth and leanlookd prophets whisper fearful change rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap the one in fear to lose what they enjoy the other to enjoy by rage and war these signs forerun the death or fall of kings farewell our countrymen are gone and fled as well assured richard their king is deadstay yet another day thou trusty welshman the king reposeth all his confidence in thee ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind i see thy glory like a shooting star fall to the base earth from the firmament thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west witnessing storms to come woe and unrest thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes and crossly to thy good all fortune goesfear not my lord that power that made you king hath power to keep you king in spite of all the means that heaven yields must be embraced and not neglected else if heaven would and we will not heavens offer we refuse the profferd means of succor and redress my lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes but presently prevent the ways to wail to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength gives in your weakness strength unto your foe and so your follies fight against yourself fear and be slain no worse can come to fight and fight and die is death destroying death where fearing dying pays death servile breath that honourable day shall neer be seen many a time hath banishd norfolk fought for jesu christ in glorious christian field streaming the ensign of the christian cross against black pagans turks and saracens and toild with works of war retired himself to italy and there at venice gave his body to that pleasant countrys earth and his pure soul unto his captain christ under whose colours he had fought so long as surely as i live my lord marry god forbid worst in this royal presence may i speak yet best beseeming me to speak the truth would god that any in this noble presence were enough noble to be upright judge of noble richard then true noblesse would learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong what subject can give sentence on his king and who sits here that is not richards subject thieves are not judged but they are by to hear although apparent guilt be seen in them and shall the figure of gods majesty his captain steward deputyelect anointed crowned planted many years be judged by subject and inferior breath and he himself not present o forfend it god that in a christian climate souls refined should show so heinous black obscene a deed i speak to subjects and a subject speaks stirrd up by god thus boldly for his king my lord of hereford here whom you call king is a foul traitor to proud herefords king and if you crown him let me prophesy the blood of english shall manure the ground and future ages groan for this foul act peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound disorder horror fear and mutiny shall here inhabit and this land be calld the field of golgotha and dead mens skulls o if you raise this house against this house it will the woefullest division prove that ever fell upon this cursed earth prevent it resist it let it not be so lest child childs children cry against you woe the woes to come the children yet unborn shall feel this day as sharp to them as thornnor near nor farther off my gracious lord than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue and bids me speak of nothing but despair one day too late i fear me noble lord hath clouded all thy happy days on earth o call back yesterday bid time return and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men today today unhappy day too late oerthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fledmore health and happiness betide my liege than can my caretuned tongue deliver himglad am i that your highness is so armd to bear the tidings of calamity like an unseasonable stormy day which makes the silver rivers drown their shores as if the world were all dissolved to tears so high above his limits swells the rage of bolingbroke covering your fearful land with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel whitebeards have armd their thin and hairless scalps against thy majesty boys with womens voices strive to speak big and clap their female joints in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows of doublefatal yew against thy state yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills against thy seat both young and old rebel and all goes worse than i have power to tell sweet love i see changing his property turns to the sourest and most deadly hate again uncurse their souls their peace is made with heads and not with hands those whom you curse have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound and lie full low graved in the hollow ground ay all of them at bristol lost their heads men judge by the complexion of the sky the state and inclination of the day so may you by my dull and heavy eye my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say i play the torturer by small and small to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken your uncle york is joind with bolingbroke and all your northern castles yielded up and all your southern gentlemen in arms upon his partypeace have they made with him indeed my lordmadam well play at bowls madam well dance madam well tell tales of either madam madam ill sing i could weep madam would it do you goodgo bind thou up yon dangling apricocks which like unruly children make their sire stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight give some supportance to the bending twigs go thou and like an executioner cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays that look too lofty in our commonwealth all must be even in our government you thus employd i will go root away the noisome weeds which without profit suck the soils fertility from wholesome flowers hold thy peace he that hath sufferd this disorderd spring hath now himself met with the fall of leaf the weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter that seemd in eating him to hold him up are pluckd up root and all by bolingbroke i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green they are and bolingbroke hath seized the wasteful king o what pity is it that he had not so trimmd and dressd his land as we this garden we at time of year do wound the bark the skin of our fruittrees lest being overproud in sap and blood with too much riches it confound itself had he done so to great and growing men they might have lived to bear and he to taste their fruits of duty superfluous branches we lop away that bearing boughs may live had he done so himself had borne the crown which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down depressd he is already and deposed tis doubt he will be letters came last night to a dear friend of the good duke of yorks that tell black tidings pardon me madam little joy have i to breathe this news yet what i say is true king richard he is in the mighty hold of bolingbroke their fortunes both are weighd in your lords scale is nothing but himself and some few vanities that make him light but in the balance of great bolingbroke besides himself are all the english peers and with that odds he weighs king richard down post you to london and you will find it so i speak no more than every one doth knowpoor queen so that thy state might be no worse i would my skill were subject to thy curse here did she fall a tear here in this place ill set a bank of rue sour herb of grace rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen in the remembrance of a weeping queenprinces and noble lords what answer shall i make to this base man shall i so much dishonour my fair stars on equal terms to give him chastisement either i must or have
