now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lourd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass i that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtaild of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair wellspoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewd up about a prophecy which says that g of edwards heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes   brother good day what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace upon what cause alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be newchristend in the tower but whats the matter clarence  may i know why this it is when men are ruled by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliverd we are not safe clarence we are not safe humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty ill tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous oerworn widow and herself since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in this monarchy even so ant please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shores wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks how say you sir can you deny all this naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best he do it secretly alone her husband knave wouldst thou betray me we are the queens abjects and must obey brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoever you will employ me in were it to call king edwards widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine well your imprisonment shall not be long meantime have patience go tread the path that thou shalt neer return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the newdeliverd hastings as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brookd imprisonment no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevaild as much on him as you what news abroad now by saint paul this news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person tis very grievous to be thought upon what is he in his bed go you before and i will follow you   he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be packd with posthorse up to heaven ill in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeld with weighty arguments and if i fall not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then ill marry warwicks youngest daughter what though i killd her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains stay you that bear the corse and set it down villains set down the corse or by saint paul ill make a corse of him that disobeys unmannerd dog stand thou when i command advance thy halbert higher than my breast or by saint paul ill strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses but i know none and therefore am no beast more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposedevils to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself by such despair i should accuse myself say that i slew them not i did not kill your husband nay he is dead and slain by edwards hand i was provoked by her slanderous tongue which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders i grant ye the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth yes one place else if you will hear me name it your bedchamber so will it madam till i lie with you i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom these eyes could never endure sweet beautys wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth you he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband he lives that loves thee better than he could plantagenet the selfsame name but one of better nature here   why dost thou spit at me never came poison from so sweet a place thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspect with store of childish drops these eyes that never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my fathers death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standersby had wet their cheeks like trees bedashd with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak   teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee   nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but twas thy beauty that provoked me nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward but twas thy heavenly face that set me on   take up the sword again or take up me then bid me kill myself and i will do it tush that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word that hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary tis figured in my tongue then never man was true say then my peace is made but shall i live in hope vouchsafe to wear this ring look how this ring encompasseth finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted suppliant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever that it would please thee leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby place where after i have solemnly interrd at chertsey monastery this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon bid me farewell sirs take up the corse no to whitefriars there attend my coining   was ever woman in this humour wood was ever woman in this humour won ill have her but i will not keep her long what i that killd her husband and his father to take her in her hearts extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of her hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i nothing to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbd in my angry mood at tewksbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet debase her eyes on me that croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woful bed on me whose all not equals edwards moiety on me that halt and am unshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marvellous proper man ill be at charges for a lookingglass and entertain some score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favour with myself will maintain it with some little cost but first ill turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass they do me wrong and i will not endure it who are they that complain unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours because i cannot flatter and speak fair smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused by silken sly insinuating jacks to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace when have i injured thee when done thee wrong or thee or thee or any of your faction a plague upon you all his royal person whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile but you must trouble him with lewd complaints i cannot tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman theres many a gentle person made a jack meantime god grants that we have need of you your brother is imprisond by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt whilst many fair promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble you may deny that you were not the cause of my lord hastings late imprisonment she may lord rivers why who knows not so she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honours on your high deserts what may she not she may yea marry may she what marry may she marry with a king a bachelor a handsome stripling too i wis your grandam had a worser match what threat you me with telling of the king tell him and spare not look what i have said i will avouch in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to the tower tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot ere you were queen yea or your husband king i was a packhorse in his great affairs a weederout of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spilt mine own in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster and rivers so were you was not your husband in margarets battle at saint albans slain let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere now and what you are withal what i have been and what i am poor clarence did forsake his father warwick yea and forswore himselfwhich jesu pardon to fight on edwards party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mewd up i would to god my heart were flint like edwards or edwards soft and pitiful like mine i am too childishfoolish for this world if i should be i had rather be a pedlar far be it from my heart the thought of it foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight wert thou not banished on pain of death the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout steepd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all falln upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed have done thy charm thou hateful witherd hag margaret ha i cry thee mercy then for i had thought that thou hadst calld me all these bitter names tis done by me and ends in margaret good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess yea and much more but i was born so high our aery buildeth in the cedars top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun what doth she say my lord of buckingham i cannot blame her by gods holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her but you have all the vantage of her wrong i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is frankd up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause of it so do i ever   being welladvised for had i cursed now i had cursed myself i do the wrong and first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to hastings derby buckingham and say it is the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil   but soft here come my executioners how now my hardy stout resolved mates are you now going to dispatch this deed well thought upon i have it here about me   when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes drop tears i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day a blessed labour my most sovereign liege amongst this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good mens love first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodged between us of you lord rivers and lord grey of you that without desert have frownd on me dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born tonight i thank my god for my humility why madam have i offerd love for this to be so bouted in this royal presence who knows not that the noble duke is dead   you do him injury to scorn his corse but he poor soul by your first order died and that a winged mercury did bear some tardy cripple bore the countermand that came too lag to see him buried god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion this is the fruit of rashness markd you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen lookd pale when they did hear of clarence death o they did urge it still unto the king god will revenge it but come let us in to comfort edward with our company madam have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can cure their harms by wailing them madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace humbly on my knee i crave your blessing aside  amen and make me die a good old man that is the buttend of a mothers blessing i marvel why her grace did leave it out i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow madam and you my mother will you go to give your censures in this weighty business my other self my counsels consistory my oracle my prophet my dear cousin i like a child will go by thy direction towards ludlow then for well not stay behind welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the worlds deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugard words but lookd not on the poison of their hearts  god keep you from them and from such false friends my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you where it seems best unto your royal self if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation aside  so wise so young they say do never live long i say without characters fame lives long   thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word aside  short summers lightly have a forward spring how fares our cousin noble lord of york he hath my lord o my fair cousin i must not say so he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman my dagger little cousin with all my heart a greater gift than that ill give my cousin a gentle cousin were it light enough it is too heavy for your grace to wear what would you have my weapon little lord how my lord willt please you pass along myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you why what should you fear nor none that live i hope no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable he is all the mothers from the top to toe commend me to lord william tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries tomorrow are let blood at pomfretcastle and bid my friend for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep at crosby place there shall you find us both chop off his head man somewhat we will do and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and the moveables whereof the king my brother stood possessd and look to have it yielded with all willingness come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form my noble lords and cousins all good morrow i have been long a sleeper but i hope my absence doth neglect no great designs which by my presence might have been concluded than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them cousin of buckingham a word with you   catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot as he will lose his head ere give consent his masters son as worshipful as he terms it shall lose the royalty of englands throne i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damned witchcraft and that have prevaild upon my body with their hellish charms then be your eyes the witness of this ill see how i am bewitchd behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling witherd up and this is edwards wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me if i thou protector of this damned strumpet tellest thou me of ifs  thou art a traitor off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same lovel and ratcliff look that it be done the rest that love me rise and follow me come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in the middle of a word and then begin again and stop again as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror he is and see he brings the mayor along look to the drawbridge there catesby oerlook the walls look back defend thee here are enemies be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shores wife he lived from all attainder of suspect what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villains death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforced us to this execution yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning have prevented because my lord we would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death and to that end we wishd your lordship here to avoid the carping censures of the world go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetst advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edwards children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants daughters wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control listed to make his prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly as twere far off because you know my lord my mother lives if you thrive well bring them to baynards castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw   go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynards castle   now will i in to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes how now my lord what say the citizens touchd you the bastardy of edwards children ah and did they so what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt well bring it to a happy issue my lord there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me who earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your graces pleasure i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the citys eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance else wherefore breathe i in a christian land i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tonguetied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasond with your faithful love to me then on the other side i chequed my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smotherd but god be thankd theres no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him alas why would you heap these cares on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you o do not swear my lord of buckingham would you enforce me to a world of care well call them again i am not made of stone but penetrable to your kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul   cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof in saying so you shall but say the truth even when you please since you will have it so come let us to our holy task again farewell good cousin farewell gentle friendshis majesty tendering my persons safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower because my name is george yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the crossrow plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now by heaven i think theres no man is secure but the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey i know it pleaseth neither of us well i must perforce farewell o i have passd a miserable night so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embarkd to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befalln us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main lord lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears what ugly sights of death within mine eyes methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatterd in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems which wood the slimy bottom of the deep and mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood kept in my soul and would not let it forth to seek the empty vast and wandering air but smotherd it within my panting bulk which almost burst to belch it in the sea o no my dream was lengthend after life o then began the tempest to my soul who passd methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick who cried aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanishd then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environd me about and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling waked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made the dream o brakenbury i have done those things which now bear evidence against my soul for edwards sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine in gods name what art thou but not as i am royal thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak your eyes do menace me why look you pale who sent you hither wherefore do you come to murder me you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it wherein my friends have i offended you i shall be reconciled to him again are you calld forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent what is my offence where are the evidence that do accuse me what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence death before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable erroneous vassal the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands to hurl upon their heads that break his law alas for whose sake did i that ill deed for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i if god will be revenged for this deed o know you yet he doth it publicly take not the quarrel from his powerful arm he needs no indirect nor lawless course to cut off those that have offended him my brothers love the devil and my rage oh if you love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well if you be hired for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death o no he loves me and he holds me dear go you to him from me tell him when that our princely father york blessd his three sons with his victorious arm and charged us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship bid gloucester think of this and he will weep o do not slander him for he is kind it cannot be for when i parted with him he huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labour my delivery hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul to counsel me to make my peace with god and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind that thou wilt war with god by murdering me ah sirs consider he that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed relent and save your souls not to relent is beastly savage devilish which of you if you were a princes son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities noti beseech your graces both to pardon me his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference of what degree soever with his brother with this my lord myself have nought to do what one my lord i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke why looks your grace so heavily today what was your dream i long to hear you tell it had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep awaked you not with this sore agony no marvel my lord though it affrighted you i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it i will my lord god give your grace good rest   sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide night princes have but their tides for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imagination they often feel a world of restless cares so that betwixt their tides and low names theres nothing differs but the outward fame in gods name what are you and how came you hither yea are you so brief i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands i will not reason what is meant hereby because i will be guiltless of the meaning here are the keys there sits the duke asleep ill to the king and signify to him that thus i have resignd my charge to you right well dear madam by your patience i may not suffer you to visit them the king hath straitly charged the contrary i cry you mercy i mean the lord protector no madam no i may not leave it so i am bound by oath and therefore pardon megood time of day unto my gracious lord with patience noble lord as prisoners must but i shall live my lord to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment more pity that the eagle should be mewd while kites and buzzards prey at liberty no news so bad abroad as this at home the king is sickly weak and melancholy and his physicians fear him mightily he is o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe and the most merciless that eer was heard of falseboding woman end thy frantic curse lest to thy harm thou move our patience my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses so thrive i as i truly swear the like so prosper i as i swear perfect love and so swear i my lord and so say i on what occasion god he knows not i the queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace but by his mother was perforce

pomfret bloodily were butcherd and i myself secure in grace and favour o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings wretched head o momentary grace of mortal men which we more

richard miserable england i prophesy the fearfulst time to thee that ever wretched age hath lookd upon come lead me to the block bear him my head they smile at me that shortly shall be deadset down set down your honourable load if honour may be shrouded in a hearse whilst i awhile obsequiously lament the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster poor keycold figure of a holy king pale ashes of the house of lancaster thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost to hear the lamentations of poor anne wife to thy edward to thy slaughterd son stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds lo in these windows that let forth thy life i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it cursed the blood that let this blood from hence more direful hap betide that hated wretch that makes us wretched by the death of thee than i can wish to adders spiders toads or any creeping venomd thing that lives if ever he have child abortive be it prodigious and untimely brought to light whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view and that be heir to his unhappiness if ever he have wife let her he made a miserable by the death of him as i am made by my poor lord and thee come now towards chertsey with your holy load taken from pauls to be interred there and still as you are weary of the weight rest you whiles i lament king henrys corse black night oershade thy day and death thy life why that was he arise dissembler though i wish thy death i will not be the executioner with all my heart and much it joys me too to see you are become so penitent tressel and berkeley go along with me tis more than you deserve but since you teach me how to flatter you imagine i have said farewell already god give your graces both a happy and a joyful time of daywhat black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds what do you tremble are you all afraid alas i blame you not for you are mortal and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell thou hadst but power over his mortal body his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone foul devil for gods sake hence and trouble us not for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds behold this pattern of thy butcheries o gentlemen see see dead henrys wounds open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh blush blush thou lump of foul deformity for tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells thy deed inhuman and unnatural provokes this deluge most unnatural o god which this blood madest revenge his death o earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead or earth gape open wide and eat him quick as thou dost swallow up this good kings blood which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered villain thou knowst no law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity o wonderful when devils tell the truth vouchsafe defused infection of a man for these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursed self fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself which didst unworthy slaughter upon others why then they are not dead but dead they are and devilish slave by thee why then he is alive in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood the which thou once didst bend against her breast but that thy brothers beat aside the point thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind which never dreamt on aught but butcheries didst thou not kill this king dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed o he was gentle mild and virtuous he is in heaven where thou shalt never come and thou unfit for any place but hell some dungeon ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest i hope so thou art the cause and most accursed

to their sights ill bear thy blame and take thy office from thee on my peril despiteful tidings o unpleasing news and i in all unwillingness will go i would to god that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were redhot steel to sear me to the brain anointed let me be with deadly venom and die ere men can say god save the queen no why  when he that is my husband now came to me as i followd henrys corse when scarce the blood was well washd from his hands which issued from my other angel husband and that dead saint which then i weeping followd o when i say i lookd on richards face this was my wish be thou quoth i  accursed for making me so young so old a widow and when thou wedst let sorrow haunt thy bed and be thy wifeif any be so mad as miserable by the life of thee as thou hast made me by my dear lords death lo ere i can repeat this curse again even in so short a space my womans heart grossly grew captive to his honey words and proved the subject of my own souls curse which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest for never yet one hour in his bed have i enjoyd the golden dew of sleep but have been waked by his timorous dreams besides he hates me for my father warwick and will no doubt shortly be rid of me no more than from my soul i mourn for yours adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of itmy lord stand back and let the coffin passtowards chertsey

golden crown where should be graven if that right were right the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown and the dire death of my two sons and brothers tell me thou villain slave where are my children where is kind hastings rivers vaughan grey though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse abides in me i say amen to all i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to murder for my daughters richard they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens and therefore level not to hit their lives and must she die for this o let her live and ill corrupt her manners stain her beauty slander

life cousins indeed and by their uncle cozend of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts thy head all indirectly gave direction no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart to revel in the entrails of my lambs but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes and i in such a desperate bay of death like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom what good is coverd with the face of heaven to be discoverd that can do me good up to some scaffold there to lose their heads flatter my sorrows with report of it tell me what state what dignity what honour canst thou demise to any child of mine my daughters mother thinks it with her soul say then who dost thou mean shall be her king what thou how canst thou woo her send to her by the man that slew her brothers a pair of bleedinghearts thereon engrave edward and york then haply she will weep therefore present to heras sometime margaret did to thy father steepd in rutlands blood a handkerchief which say to her did drain the purple sap from her sweet brothers body and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith if this inducement force her not to love send her a story of thy noble acts tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence her uncle rivers yea and for her sake madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil what were i best to say her fathers brother would be her lord or shall i say her uncle or he that slew her brothers and her uncles under what title shall i woo for thee that god the law my honour and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years which she shall purchase with still lasting war that at her hands which the kings king forbids to wail the tide as her mother doth but how long shall that title ever last but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last so long as hell and richard likes of it but she your subject loathes such sovereignty an honest tale speeds best being plainly told plain and not honest is too harsh a style o no my reasons are too deep and dead too deep and dead poor infants in their grave harp on it still shall i till heartstrings break profaned dishonourd and the third usurpd by nothing for this is no oath the george profaned hath lost his holy honour the garter blemishd pawnd his knightly virtue the crown usurpd disgraced his kingly glory if something thou wilt swear to be believed swear then by something that thou hast not wrongd shall i be tempted of the devil thus shall i forget myself to be myself but thou didst kill my children shall i go win my daughter to thy will i go write to me very shortly and you shall understand from me her mindgood time of day unto your royal grace madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully madam we did he desires to make atonement betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain and sent to warn them to his royal presence northumberland then present wept to see it have done for shame if not for charity have done have done nor no one here for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air nothing that i respect my gracious lord whenever buckingham doth turn his hate on you or yours   but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours god punish me with hate in those where i expect most love when i have most need to employ a friend and most assured that he is a friend deep hollow treacherous and full of guile be he unto me this do i beg of god when i am cold in zeal to yours and in good time here comes the noble duke look i so pale lord dorset as the rest we wait upon your grace you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers that bear this mutual heavy load of moan now cheer each other in each others love though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts but lately splinterd knit and joind together must gently be preserved cherishd and kept me seemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetchd hither to london to be crownd our king marry my lord lest by a multitude the newheald wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented my lord whoever journeys to the prince for gods sake let not us two be behind for by the way ill sort occasion as index to the story we late talkd of to part the queens proud kindred from the king welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber and in good time here comes the sweating lord fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce you are too senselessobstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claimd it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children neer till now he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have reedified upon record my gracious lord what my gracious lord now in good time here comes the duke of york with what a sharpprovided wit he reasons to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself so cunning and so young is wonderful think you my lord this little prating york was not incensed by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously well let them rest come hither catesby thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart thou knowst our reasons urged upon the way what thinkst thou is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the instalment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle what thinkst thou then of stanley what will he well then no more but this go gentle catesby and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings how doth he stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the tower to sit about the coronation if thou dost find him tractable to us encourage him and show him all our reasons if he be leaden icycold unwilling be thou so too and so break off your talk and give us notice of his inclination for we tomorrow hold divided councils wherein thyself shalt highly be employd good catesby go effect this business soundly now my lord what shall we do if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots ill claim that promise at your graces hands what talking with a priest lord chamberlain your friends at pomfret they do need the priest your honour hath no shriving work in hand i do my lord but long i shall not stay i shall return before your lordship thence aside  and supper too although thou knowst it not come will you go are all things fitting for that royal time who knows the lord protectors mind herein who is most inward with the royal duke who i my lord i we know each others faces but for our hearts he knows no more of mine than i of yours nor i no more of his than you of mine lord hastings you and he are near in love had not you come upon your cue my lord william lord hastings had pronounced your part i mean your voicefor crowning of the king withdraw you hence my lord ill follow you tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems but what is catesby gone lord mayor hark a drum lord mayor the reason we have sent god and our innocency defend and guard us well well he was the covertst shelterd traitor that ever lived would you imagine or almost believe weret not that by great preservation we live to tell it you the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the councilhouse to murder me and my good lord of gloucester but since you come too late of our intents yet witness what you hear we did intend and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell fear not my lord ill play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu i go and towards three or four oclock look for the news that the guildhall affords now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum and speak not a word i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france the insatiate greediness of his desires and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your dicipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose untouchd or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory grew to an end i bid them that did love their countrys good cry god save richard englands royal king no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones gazed each on other and lookd deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and askd the mayor what meant this wilful silence his answer was the people were not wont to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd but nothing spake in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at the lower end of the hall hurld up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and loving shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard and even here brake off and came away no by my troth my lord the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayerbook in your hand and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord for on that ground ill build a holy descant and be not easily won to our request play the maids part still answer nay and take it go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks     welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal   here comes his servant how now catesby what says he return good catesby to thy lord again tell him myself the mayor and citizens in deep designs and matters of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd daybed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this gracious prince take on himself the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall neer win him to it i fear he will   how now catesby what says your lord sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven i come in perfect love to him and so once more return and tell his grace   when holy and devout religious men are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ears to our request and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovernd isle you have my lord would it might please your grace at our entreaties to amend that fault then know it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the scepterd office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our countrys good this noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shoulderd in the swallowing gulf of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for anothers gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just suit come i to move your grace my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered you say that edward is your brothers son so say we too but not by edwards wife for first he was contract to lady lucy your mother lives a witness to that vow and afterward by substitute betrothd to bona sister to the king of france these both put by a poor petitioner a carecrazed mother of a many children a beautywaning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his lustful eye seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners term the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this profferd benefit of dignity if non to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal truederived course refuse not mighty lord this profferd love if you refuse itas in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brothers son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kin and egally indeed to all estates yet whether you accept our suit or no your brothers son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you come citizens zounds ill entreat no more then i salute you with this kingly title long live richard englands royal king tomorrow will it please you to be crownd tomorrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave my gracious sovereign still live they and for ever may they last say on my loving lord why so you are my thrice renowned liege true noble prince your grace may do your pleasure give me some breath some little pause my lord before i positively herein i will resolve your grace immediately my lord i have considerd in my mind the late demand that you did sound me in i hear that news my lord my lord i claim your gift my due by promise for which your honour and your faith is pawnd the earldom of hereford and the moveables the which you promised i should possess what says your highness to my just demand my lord my lord your promise for the earldom my lord i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me upon the stroke of ten why let it strike why then resolve me whether you will or no is it even so rewards he my true service with such deep contempt made i him king for this o let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock while my fearful head is on will not king richard let me speak with him hastings and edwards children rivers grey holy king henry and thy fair son edward vaughan and all that have miscarried by underhand corrupted foul injustice if that your moody discontented souls do through the clouds behold this present hour even for revenge mock my destruction this is allsouls day fellows is it not why then allsouls day is my bodys doomsday this is the day that in king edwards time i wisht might fall on me when i was found false to his children or his wifes allies this is the day wherein i wishd to fall by the false faith of him i trusted most this this allsouls day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs that high allseer that i dallied with hath turnd my feigned prayer on my head and given in earnest what i beggd in jest thus doth he force the swords of wicked men to turn their own points on their masters bosoms now margarets curse is fallen upon my head when he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow remember margaret was a prophetess come sirs convey me to the block of shame wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame to king richard iii the last was i that helped thee to the crown the last was i that felt thy tyranny o in the battle think on buckingham and die in terror of thy guiltiness dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death fainting despair despairing yield thy breath   i died for hope ere i could lend thee aid but cheer thy heart and be thou not dismayd god and good angel fight on richmonds side and richard falls in height of all his pridegod make your majesty joyful as you have been i do beseech you either not believe the envious slanders of her false accusers or if she be accused in true report bear with her

his neighbours wife but it detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that i found it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it o excellent devise make a sop of him no first lets reason with him a man as you are nor you as we are loyal my voice is now the kings my looks mine own never my lord therefore prepare to die and he that hath commanded is the

brother slew no man his fault was thought and yet his punishment was cruel death who sued to me for him who in my rage kneeld at my feet and bade me be advised who spake of brotherhood who spake of love who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty warwick and did fight for me who told me in the field by tewksbury when oxford had me down he rescued me and said dear brother live and be a king who told me when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death how he did lap me even in his own garments and gave himself all thin and naked to the numb cold night all this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluckd and not a man of you had so much grace to put it in my mind but when your carters or your waitingvassals have done a drunken slaughter and defaced the precious image of our dear redeemer you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon and i unjustly too must grant it you but for my brother not a man would speak nor i ungracious speak unto myself for him poor soul

piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of dighton and forrest whom i did suborn to do this ruthless piece of butchery although they were fleshd villains bloody dogs melting with tenderness and kind compassion wept like two children in their deaths sad stories lo thus quoth dighton lay those tender babes thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another within their innocent alabaster arms their lips were four red roses on a stalk which in their summer beauty kissd each other a book of prayers on their pillow lay which once quoth forrest almost changed my mind but o the devilthere the villain stoppd whilst dighton thus told on we smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature that from the prime creation eer she framed thus both are gone with conscience and remorse they could not speak and so i left them both to bring this tidings to the bloody king and here he comes   all hail my sovereign liege if to have done the thing you gave in charge beget your happiness be happy then for it is done my lord i did my lord the chaplain of the tower hath buried them but how or in what place i do not knowthe news i have to tell your majesty is that by sudden

course if by the way they be not fought withalno my good lord therefore be patient it is my lordfellows in arms and my most loving friends bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny thus far into the bowels of the land have we marchd on without impediment and here receive we from our father stanley lines of fair comfort and encouragement the wretched bloody and usurping boar that spoild your summer fields and fruitful vines swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough in your embowelld bosoms this foul swine lies now even in the centre of this isle near to the town of leicester as we learn from tamworth thither is but one days march in gods name cheerly on courageous friends to reap the harvest of perpetual peace by this one bloody trial of sharp war all for our vantage then in gods name march true hope is swift and flies with swallows wings kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings the weary sun hath made a golden set and by the bright track of his fiery car gives

troubled thoughts to take a nap lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow when i should mount with wings of victory once more good night kind lords and gentlemen   o thou whose captain i account myself look on my forces with a gracious eye put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath that they may crush down with a heavy fall the usurping helmets of our adversaries make us thy ministers of chastisement that we may praise thee in the victory to thee i do commend my watchful soul ere i let fall the windows of mine eyes sleeping and waking o defend me still     ghost cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen that you have taen a tardy sluggard here the sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams that ever enterd in a drowsy head have i since your departure had my lords methought their souls whose bodies richard murderd came to my tent and cried on victory i promise you my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream how far into the morning is it lords why then tis time to arm and give direction   more than i have said loving countrymen the leisure and enforcement of the time forbids to dwell upon yet remember this god and our good cause fight upon our side the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls like highreard bulwarks stand before our faces richard except those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow for what is he they follow  truly gentlemen a bloody tyrant and a homicide one raised in blood and one in blood establishd one that made means to come by what he hath and slaughterd those that were the means to help him abase foul stone made precious by the foil of englands chair where he is falsely set one that hath ever been gods enemy then if you fight against gods enemy god will in justice ward you as his soldiers if you do sweat to put a tyrant down you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain if you do fight against your countrys foes your countrys fat shall pay your pains the hire if you do fight in safeguard of your wives your wives shall welcome home the conquerors if you do free your children from the sword your childrens children quit it in your age then in the name of god and all these rights advance your standards draw your willing swords for me the ransom of my bold attempt shall be this cold corpse on the earths cold face but if i thrive the gain of my attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully god and saint george richmond and victory god and your arms be praised victorious friends the day is ours the bloody dog is dead great god of heaven say amen to all but tell me is young george stanley living what men of name are slain on either side inter their bodies as becomes their births proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled that in

traitor hears me and says not amen england hath long been mad and scarrd herself the brother blindly shed the brothers blood the father rashly slaughterd his own son the son compelld been butcher to

their heirs god if thy will be so enrich the time to come with smoothfaced peace with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days abate the edge of traitors gracious lord that would reduce these bloody days again and make poor england weep in streams of blood let them not live to taste this lands increase that would with treason wound this fair lands peace now civil wounds are stoppd peace lives
