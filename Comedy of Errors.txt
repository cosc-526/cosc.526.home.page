proceed solinus to procure my fall and by the doom of death end woes and all yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence ill utter what my sorrows give me leave in syracusa was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad with her i lived in joy our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factors death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguishd but by names that very hour and in the selfsame inn a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike thosefor their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard a league from epidamnum had we saild before the always windobeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embraced yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear forced me to seek delays for them and me and this it was for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinkingripe to us my wife more careful for the latterborn had fastend him unto a small spare mast such as seafaring men provide for storms to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd fastend ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispersed those vapours that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas waxd calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this but ere they cameo let me say no more gather the sequel by that went before o had the gods done so i had not now worthily termd them merciless to us for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encounterd by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought at length another ship had seized on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their shipwreckd guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course thus have you heard me severd from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolongd to tell sad stories of my own mishaps my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendantso his case was like reft of his brother but retaind his name might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labourd of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i loved five summers have i spent in furthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend but to procrastinate his lifeless end unless the fear of death doth make me dote i see my son antipholus and dromio antipholus most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me is not your name sir calld antipholus and is not that your bondman dromio i am sure you both of you remember me why look you strange on me you know me well o grief hath changed

little use to hear all these old witnessesi cannot err tell me thou art my son antipholus antipholus but seven years since in syracusa boy thou knowst we parted but perhaps my son thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery antipholus if i dream not thou art aemilia if thou art she tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raftmerchant of syracuse plead no more i am not partial to infringe our laws the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants our welldealing countrymen who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods excludes all pity from our threatening looks for since the mortal and intestine jars twixt thy seditious countrymen and us it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus he dies his goods confiscate to the dukes dispose unless a thousand marks be levied to quit the penalty and to ransom him thy substance valued at the highest rate cannot amount unto a hundred marks therefore by law thou art condemned to die well syracusian say in brief the cause why thou departedst from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befalln of them and thee till now hapless aegeon whom the fates have markd to bear the extremity of dire mishap now trust me were

bear my wealth at any time tis so and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have good sir draw near to me ill speak to him signior antipholus i wonder much that you would put me to this shame and trouble and not without some scandal to yourself with circumstance and oaths so to deny this chain which now you wear so openly beside the charge the shame imprisonment you have done wrong to this my honest friend who but for staying on our controversy had hoisted sail and put to sea today this chain you had of me can you deny it antipholus i knew he was not in his perfect wits upon what cause see where they come we will behold his death o perjured woman they are both forsworn in this the madman justly chargeth them antipholus my lord in truth thus far i witness with him that he dined not at home but was lockd out he had my lord and when he ran in here these people saw the chain about his neck that is the chain sir which you had of me antipholus i think i did sir i deny it notyou know since pentecost the sum is due and since i have not much importuned you nor now i had not but that i am bound to persia and want guilders for my voyage therefore make present satisfaction or ill attach you by this officer the hour steals on i pray you sir dispatch my business cannot brook this dalliance good sir say whether youll answer me or no if not ill leave him to the officer antipholus well officer arrest him at my suit how is the man esteemed here in the city speak softly yonder as i think he walks yes that you did sir and forswore it too antipholus these ears of mine thou knowst did hear thee fie on thee wretch tis pity that thou livest to walk where any honest man resort antipholus i dare and do defy thee for a villain i am sorry now that i did draw on him by this i think the dial points at five anon im sure the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale the place of death and sorry execution behind the ditches of the abbey here besides i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart and thereupon i drew my sword on you and then you fled into this abbey here from whence i think you are come by miracle antipholusthat labour may you save see where he comes antipholus i do and charge you in the dukes name to obey me i do arrest you sir you hear the suit antipholus good sir be patient good now hold thy tongue masters let him go he is my prisoner and you shall not have him he is my prisoner if i let him go the debt he owes will be required of me one angelo a goldsmith do you know him two hundred ducats due for a chain your husband had of him away theyll kill us   antipholuswell met well met master antipholus i see sir you have found the goldsmith now is that the chain you promised me today antipholus your man and you are marvellous merry sir will you go with me well mend our dinner here give me the ring of mine you had at dinner or for my diamond the chain you promised and ill be gone sir and not trouble you i pray you sir my ring or else the chain i hope you do not mean to cheat me so antipholus now out of doubt antipholus is mad else would he never so demean himself a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats and for the same he promised me a chain both one and other he denies me now the reason that i gather he is mad besides this present instance of his rage is a mad tale he told today at dinner of his own doors being shut against his entrance belike his wife acquainted with his fits on purpose shut the doors against his way my way is now to hie home to his house and tell his wife that being lunatic he rushd into my house and took perforce my ring away this course i fittest choose for forty ducats is too much to lose how say you now is not your husband mad mark how he trembles in his ecstasy when as your husband all in rage today came to my house and took away my ring the ring i saw upon his finger now straight after did i meet him with a chain he did and from my finger snatchd that ring antipholus as sure my liege as i do see your grace sir i must have that diamond from you antipholusgive me your hand and let me feel your pulse antipholus i charge thee satan housed within this man to yield possession to my holy prayers and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven antipholus it is no shame the fellow finds his vein and yielding to him humours well his frenzy antipholus mistress both man and master is possessd i know it by their pale and deadly looks they must be bound and laid in some dark room antipholus more company the fiend is strong within him go bind this man for he is frantic toobe quiet people wherefore throng you hither how long hath this possession held the man hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea buried some dear friend hath not else his eye strayd his affection in unlawful love a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing which of these sorrows is he subject to you should for that have reprehended him ay but not rough enough haply in private ay but not enough and thereof came it that the man was mad the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dogs tooth it seems his sleeps were hinderd by thy railing and therefore comes it that his head is light thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions thereof the raging fire of fever bred and whats a fever but a fit of madness thou sayst his sports were hinderd by thy brawls sweet recreation barrd what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life in food in sport and lifepreserving rest to be disturbd would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits no not a creature enters in my house neither he took this place for sanctuary and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again or lose my labour in assaying it be patient for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers to make of him a formal man again it is a branch and parcel of mine oath a charitable duty of my order therefore depart and leave him here with me be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him most mighty duke behold a man much wrongd whoever bound him i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty speak
