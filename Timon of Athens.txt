what have you there upon the heels of my presentment sir lets see your piece so tis this comes off well and excellent admirable how this grace speaks his own standing what a mental power this eye shoots forth how big imagination moves in this lip to the dumbness of the gesture one might interpret i will say of it it tutors nature artificial strife lives in these touches livelier than life the senators of athens happy man you see this confluence this great flood of visitors i have in this rough work shaped out a man whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug with amplest entertainment my free drift halts not particularly but moves itself in a wide sea of wax no levelld malice infects one comma in the course i hold but flies an eagle flight bold and forth on leaving no tract behind i will unbolt to you you see how all conditions how all minds as well of glib and slippery creatures as of grave and austere quality tender down their services to lord timon his large fortune upon his good and gracious nature hanging subdues and properties to his love and tendance all sorts of hearts yea from the glassfaced flatterer to apemantus that few things loves better than to abhor himself even he drops down the knee before him and returns in peace most rich in timons nod sir i have upon a high and pleasant hill feignd fortune to be throned the base o the mount is rankd with all deserts all kind of natures that labour on the bosom of this sphere to propagate their states amongst them all whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixd one do i personate of lord timons frame whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her whose present grace to present slaves and servants translates his rivals nay sir but hear me on all those which were his fellows but of late some better than his value on the moment follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear make sacred even his stirrup and through him drink the free air when fortune in her shift and change of mood spurns down her late beloved all his dependants which labourd after him to the mountains top even on their knees and hands let him slip down not one accompanying his declining foot vouchsafe my labour and long live your lordship how now philosopher art not one then i lie not yes thats not feigned he is so whats to be thought of him does the rumour hold for true that hes so full of gold then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends what have you now to present unto him i must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming toward him i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him it must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency nay lets seek him then do we sin against our own estate when we may profit meet and come too late hail worthy timon sir having often of your open bounty tasted hearing you were retired your friends falln off whose thankless natureso abhorred spirits not all the whips of heaven are large enough what to you whose starlike nobleness gave life and influence to their whole being i am rapt and cannot cover the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude with any size of words nor ii am glad youre well it wears sir as it grows i know them both th others a jeweller you are rapt sir in some work some dedication to the great lord a picture sir when comes your book forth tis a good piece indifferent it is a pretty mocking of the life here is a touch ist good how this lord is followd look more how shall i understand

happiness would be well expressd in our condition ay marry what of these tis common a thousand moral paintings i can show that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortunes more pregnantly than words yet you do well to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen the foot above the head a piece of painting which i do beseech your lordship to accept the gods preserve ye youre a dog as i took note of the place it cannot be far where he abides certain alcibiades reports it phrynia and timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum nothing else you shall see him a palm in athens again and flourish with the highest therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be a just true report that goes of his having nothing at this time but my visitation only i will promise him an excellent piece good as the best promising is the very air o the time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it true

hungerly on your sight my heart is ever at your service my lord so the were bleedingnew my lord theres no meat like em i could wish my best friend at such a feast ay defiled land my lord honour health and compassion to the senate i am an humble suitor to your virtues for pity is the virtue of the law and none but tyrants use it cruelly it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy upon a friend of mine who in hot blood hath steppd into the law which is past depth to those that without heed do plunge into t he is a man setting his fate aside of comely virtues nor did he soil the fact with cowardice an honour in him which buys out his fault but with a noble fury and fair spirit seeing his reputation touchd to death he did oppose his foe and with such sober and unnoted passion he did behave his anger ere twas spent as if he had but proved an argument my lord my lords then under favour pardon me if i speak like a captain why do fond men expose themselves to battle and not endure all threats sleep upont and let the foes quietly cut their throats without repugnancy if there be such valour in the bearing what make we abroad why then women are more valiant that stay at home if bearing carry it and the ass more captain than the lion the felon loaden with irons wiser than the judge if wisdom be in suffering o my lords as you are great be pitifully good who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood to kill i grant is sins extremest gust but in defence by mercy tis most just to be in anger is impiety but who is man that is not angry weigh but the crime with this in vain his service done at lacedaemon and byzantium were a sufficient briber for his life i say my lords he has done fair service and slain in fight many of your enemies how full of valour did he bear himself in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds hard fate he might have died in war my lords if not for any parts in him though his right arm might purchase his own time and be in debt to noneyet more to move you take my deserts to his and join em both and for i know your reverend ages love security ill pawn my victories all my honours to you upon his good returns if by this crime he owes the law his life why let the war receive t in valiant gore for law is strict and war is nothing more must it be so it must not be my lords i do beseech you know me call me to your remembrances i cannot think but your age has forgot me it could not else be i should prove so base to sue and be denied such common grace my wounds ache at you banish me banish your dotage banish usury that makes the senate ugly now the gods keep you old enough that you may live only in bone that none may look on you im worse than mad i have kept back their foes while they have told their money and let out their coin upon large interest i myself rich only in large hurts all those for this is this the balsam that the usuring senate pours into captains wounds banishment it comes not ill i hate not to be banishd it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury that i may strike at athens ill cheer up my discontented troops and lay for hearts tis honour with most lands to be at odds soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods what art thou there speak what is thy name is man so hateful to thee that art thyself a man i know thee well but in thy fortunes am unlearnd and strange how came the noble timon to this change noble timon what friendship may i do thee what is it timon i have heard in some sort of thy miseries i see them now then was a blessed time pardon him sweet timandra for his wits are drownd and lost in his calamities i have but little gold of late brave timon the want whereof doth daily make revolt in my penurious band i have heard and grieved how cursed athens mindless of thy worth forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states but for thy sword and fortune trod upon them i am thy friend and pity thee dear timon why fare thee well here is some gold for thee when i have laid proud athens on a heap ay timon and have cause why me timon hast thou gold yet ill take the gold thou givest me not all thy counsel strike up the drum towards athens farewell timon if i thrive well ill visit thee again i never did thee harm callst thou that harm we but offend him strike sound to this coward and lascivious town our terrible approach     till now you have gone on and filld the time with all licentious measure making your wills the scope of justice till now myself and such as slept within the shadow of your power hav e wanderd with our traversed arms and breathed our sufferance vainly now the time is flush when crouching marrow in the bearer strong cries of itself no more now breathless wrong shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease and pursy insolence shall break his wind with fear and horrid flight then theres my glove descend and open your uncharged ports those enemies of timons and mine own whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof fall and no more and to atone your fears with my more noble meaning not a man shall pass his quarter or offend the stream of regular justice in your citys bounds but shall be renderd to your public laws at heaviest answer descend and keep your words reads the epitaph  here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft seek not my name a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left here lie i timon who alive all living men did hate pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy gait these well express in thee thy latter spirits though thou abhorrdst in us our human griefs scorndst our brains flow and those our droplets which from niggard nature fall yet rich conceit taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye on thy low grave on faults forgiven dead is noble timon of whose memory hereafter more bring me into your city and i will use the olive with my sword make war breed peace make peace stint war make each prescribe to other as each others leech let our drums strikewhat time o day ist apemantus that time serves still

debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse i am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out i am sick of that grief too as i understand how all things go a

steward no meed but he repays sevenfold above itself no gift to him but breeds the giver a return exceeding all use of quittance let it flow this way my good lord joy had the like conception in our eyes and at that instant like a babe sprung up our horses so infinitely endeard i also wish it to you i think this honourable lord did but try us this other day it should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting every man heres so what would he have borrowed of you he sent to me sirhere he comes the swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship my noble lord my most honourable

politic love this was my lords best hope now all are fled save only the gods now his friends are dead doors that were neer acquainted with their wards many a bounteous year must be employd now to

authority of manners prayd you to hold your hand more close i did endure not seldom nor no slight cheques when i have prompted you in the ebb of your estate and your great flow of debts my loved lord though you hear now too lateyet nows a time the greatest of your having lacks a half to pay your present debts tis all engaged some forfeited and gone and what remains will hardly stop the mouth of present dues the future comes apace what shall defend the interim and at length how goes our reckoning o my good lord the world is but a word were it all yours to give it in a breath how quickly were it gone if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood call me before the exactest auditors and set me on the proof so the gods bless me when all our offices have been oppressd with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept with drunken spilth of wine when every room hath blazed with lights and brayd with minstrelsy i have retired me to a wasteful cock and set mine eyes at flow heavens have i said the bounty of this lord how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants this night englutted who is not timons what heart head sword force means but is lord timons great timon noble worthy royal timon ah when the means are gone that buy this praise the breath is gone whereof this praise is made feastwon fastlost one cloud of winter showers these flies are couchd assurance bless your thoughts aside  lord lucius and lucullus hum i have been bold for that i knew it the most general way to them to use your signet and your name but they do shake their heads and i am here no richer in return they

twere sure enough why then preferrd you not your sums and bills when your false masters eat of my lords meat then they could smile and fawn upon his debts and take down the interest into their gluttonous maws you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up let me pass quietly believe t my lord and i have made an end i have no more to reckon he to spend lucilius servantay but this answer will not serve if twill not servetis not so base as you for you serve knaves   varros my dear lord my lord here my lord o my lord you only speak from your distracted soul there is not so much left to furnish

some nay put out all your hands not one word more thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor   o the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us who would not wish to be from wealth exempt since riches point to misery and contempt who would be so mockd with glory or to live but in a dream of friendship to have his pomp and all what state compounds but only painted like his varnishd friends poor honest lord brought low by his own heart undone by goodness strange unusual blood when mans worst sin is he does too much good who then dares to be half so kind again for bounty that makes gods does still mar men my dearest lord blessd to be most accursed rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes are made thy chief afflictions alas kind lord hes flung in rage from this ingrateful seat of monstrous friends nor has he with him to supply his life or that which can command it ill follow and inquire him out ill ever serve his mind with my best will whilst i have gold ill be his steward

benefit that points to me either in hope or present ild exchange for this one wish that you had power and wealth to requite me by making rich yourself o let me stay and comfort you my master it is in

born hes truly valiant that can wisely suffer the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs his outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly and neer prefer his injuries to his heart to bring it into danger if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill what folly tis to hazard life for ill you breathe in vain whats that bring us to his cave it is our part and promise to the athenians to

good boy wink at me and say thou sawest me not fare thee well ha now i see thou art a fool and fit for thy masterwe know him for no less though we are but strangers to him but i can tell you one thing my lord and which i hear from common rumours now lord timons happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece is every flatterers spirit who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish for in my knowing timon has been this lords father and kept his credit with his purse supported his estate nay timons money has paid his men their wages he neer drinks but timons silver treads upon his lip and yeto see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape he does deny him in respect of his what charitable men afford to beggars for mine own part i never tasted timon in my life nor came any of his bounties over me to mark me for his friend yet i protest for his right noble mind illustrious virtue and honourable carriage had his necessity made use of me i would have put my wealth into donation and the best half should have returnd to him so much i love his heart but i perceive men must learn now with pity to dispense for policy sits above consciencebut believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urged extremely fort and showed what necessity belonged tot and yet was denied i tell you denied my lord ay too wellsee by good hap yonders my lord i have sweat to see his honour my honoured lord may it please your honour my lord hath sent has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents but in the mean time he wants less my lord if his occasion were not virtuous i should not urge it half so faithfully upon my soultis true sir yes sir i shall if i might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour i should derive much fromt for taket of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him hes much out of health and keeps his chamber lucilius servant many do keep their chambers are not sick and if it be so far beyond his health methinks he should the sooner pay his debts and make a clear way to the gods good godsdo you observe this hostiliusreligion groans at itmust he needs trouble me in thumbove all others he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus and now ventidius is wealthy too whom he redeemd from prison all these owe their estates unto him how have they denied him has ventidius and lucullus denied him and does he send to me three hum it shows but little love or judgment in him must i be his last refuge his friends like physicians thrive give him over must i take the cure upon me has much disgraced me int im angry at him that might have known my place i see no sense fort but his occasion might have wood me first for in my conscience i was the first man that eer received gift from him and does he think so backwardly of me now that ill requite its last no so it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest and mongst lords i be thought a fool ild rather than the worth of thrice the sum had sent to me first but for my minds sake id such a courage to do him good but now return and with their faint reply this answer join who bates mine honour shall not know my coinwell met good morrow titus and hortensius yes mines three thousand crowns whats yours lucilius servantfive thousand mine varros hear you master steward wheres our master are we undone cast off nothing remainingthe like to you kind varro so is theirs and ours   lucilius servantand sir philotus too ill show you how to observe a strange event your lord sends now for money and he wears jewels now of timons gift for which i wait for money one of lord timons men lucilius servantflaminius sir a word pray is my lord ready to come forth we attend his lordship pray signify so much do you hear sir varros we wait for certain money here sir o heres servilius now we shall know some answer we cannot take this for answer sir my lord here is my bill lucilius servantheres mine mine fifty talentslucius what do we meet together lucilius servantay and i think one business does command us all for mine is money most true he does it is against my heart lucilius servantmark how strange it shows timon in this should pay more than he owes and een as if your lord should wear rich jewels and send for money for em im weary of this charge the gods can witness i know my lord hath spent of timons wealth and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth varros and mine my lord both varros servantsand ours my lord faith i perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money these debts may well be called desperate ones for a madman owes emgood day at once lucilius servant                  welcome good brother what do you think the hour labouring for nine lucilius servantso much is not my lord seen yet lucilius servantnot yet i wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven lucilius servantay but the days are waxd shorter with him you must consider that a prodigal course is like the suns but not like his recoverable i fear tis deepest winter in lord timons purse that is one may reach deep enough and yet find little i am of your fear for that all our billsno matter what hes poor and thats revenge enough who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in such may rail against great buildings as we do turn our backs from our companion thrown into his grave so his familiars to his buried fortunes slink all away leave their false vows with him like empty purses pickd and his poor self a dedicated beggar to the air with his disease of allshunnd poverty walks like contempt alone more of our fellowsmost true the law shall bruise him he has made too much plenty with em hes a sworn rioter he has a sin that often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner if there were no foes that were enough to overcome him in that beastly fury he has been known to commit outrages and cherish factions tis inferrd to us his days are foul and his drink dangerous how they confess toward thee forgetfulness too general gross which now the public body which doth seldom play the recanter feeling in itself a lack of timons aid hath sense withal of its own fail restraining aid to timon and send forth us to make their sorrowd render together with a recompense more fruitful than their offence can weigh down by the dram ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs and write in thee the figures of their love ever to read them thine our hope in him is dead let us return and strain what other means is left unto us in our dear peril we stand much hazard if they bring not timon nor are they living who were the motives that you first went out shame that they wanted cunning in excess hath broke their hearts march noble lord into our city with thy banners spread by decimation and a tithed death if thy revenges hunger for that food which nature loathestake thou the destined tenth and by the hazard of the spotted die let die the spotted what thou wilt thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile than hew tot with thy sword throw thy glove or any token of thine honour else that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress and not as our confusion all thy powers shall make their harbour in our town till we have seald thy full desirenow captain you cannot make gross sins look clear to revenge is no valour but to bear he dies we are for law he dies urge it no more on height of our displeasure friend or brother he forfeits his own blood that spills another do you dare our anger tis in few words but spacious in effect we banish thee for ever if after two days shine athens contain thee attend our weightier judgment and not to swell our spirit he shall be executed presently worthy timon the senators of athens greet thee timon o forget what we are sorry for ourselves in thee the senators with one consent of love entreat thee back to athens who have thought on special dignities which vacant lie for thy best use and wearing we speak in vain these words become your lips as they pass thorough them noble and young when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear we sent to thee to give thy rages balm to wipe out our ingratitude with loves above their quantity these walls of ours were not erected by their hands from whom you have received your griefs nor are they such that these great towers trophies and schools should fall for private faults in them all have not offended for those that were it is not square to take on those that are revenges crimes like lands are not inherited then dear countryman bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage spare thy athenian cradle and those kin which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall with those that have offended like a shepherd approach the fold and cull the infected forth but kill not all together set but thy foot against our rampired gates and they shall ope so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before to say thoult enter friendlywhat no talk of timon nothing of him expect the enemies drum is heard and fearful scouring doth choke the air with dust in and prepare ours is the fall i fear our foes the snarewhat does his lordship meani know noti have lost my gown here lies my gown one day he gives us diamonds next day stonesthy lips rot offis this the athenian minion whom the world voiced so regardfully yes hang thee monster give us some gold good timon hast thou more well more gold what then believet that well do any thing for gold more counsel with more money bounteous timonwhere should he have this gold it is some poor fragment some slender sort of his remainder the mere want of gold and the fallingfrom of his friends drove him into this melancholy he i know him tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us not to have us thrive in our mysteryit is noised he hath a mass of treasure true for he bears it not about him tis hid tis his description ill believe him as an enemy and give over my tradelet us make the assay upon him if he care not fort he will supply us easily if he covetously reserve it how shalls get it has almost charmed me from my profession by persuading me to itis not this he we cannot live on grass on berries water as beasts and birds and fishes let us first see peace in athens there is no time so miserable but a man may be truewhere save thee timon soldiers not thieves we are not thieves but men that much do wantwhat we can do well do to do you service beseech your honour to make it known to us most thankfully my lord doubt it not worthy lord do we my lord name them my lord lets know them tis most nobly spokenby all description this should be the place whos here speak ho no answer what is this timon is dead who hath outstretchd his span some beast reard this there does not live a man dead sure and this his grave whats on this tomb i cannot read the character ill take with wax our captain hath in every figure skill an aged interpreter though young in
