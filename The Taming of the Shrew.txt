this drunken man what think you if he were conveyd to bed wrappd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers a most delicious banquet by his bed and brave attendants near him when he wakes would not the beggar then forget himself even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy then take him up and manage well the jest carry him gently to my fairest chamber and hang it round with all my wanton pictures balm his foul head in warm distilled waters and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet procure me music ready when he wakes to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound and if he chance to speak

the third a diaper and say willt please your lordship cool your hands some one be ready with a costly suit and ask him what apparel he will wear another tell him of his hounds and horse and that his lady mourns at his disease persuade him that he hath been lunatic and when he says he is say that he dreams for he is nothing but a mighty lord this do and do it kindly gentle sirs it will be pastime

like a lady that done conduct him to the drunkards chamber and call him madam do him obeisance tell him from me as he will win my love he bear himself with honourable action such as he hath observed in noble ladies unto their lords by them accomplished such duty to the drunkard let him do with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy and say what ist your honour will command wherein your lady and your humble wife may show her duty and make known her love and then with kind embracements tempting kisses and with declining head into his bosom bid him shed tears as being overjoyd to see her noble lord restored to health who for this seven years hath esteemd him no better than a poor and loathsome beggar and if the boy have not a womans gift to rain a shower of commanded tears an onion will do well for such a shift which in a napkin being close conveyd shall in despite enforce a watery eye see this dispatchd with all the haste thou canst anon ill give thee more instructions   i know the boy will well usurp the grace voice gait and action of a gentlewoman i long to hear him call the drunkard husband and how my men will stay themselves from laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant

suppertime ere you come there the moon the sun it is not moonlight now i know it is the sun that shines so bright forward i pray since we have come so far and be it moon or sun or what you please an if you please to call it a rushcandle henceforth i vow it shall be so for me i know it is the moon then god be blessd it is the blessed sun but sun it is not when you say it is not and the moon changes even as your mind what you will have it named even that it is and so it shall be so for katharina young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet whither away or where is thy abode happy the parents of so fair a child happier the man whom favourable stars allot thee for his lovely bedfellow pardon old father my mistaking eyes that have been so bedazzled with the sun that everything i look on seemeth green now i perceive thou art a reverend father pardon i pray thee for my mad mistaking husband lets follow to see the end of this ado what in the midst of the street no sir god forbid but ashamed to kiss nay i will give thee a kiss now pray thee love stay mistress how mean you that he that is giddy thinks the world turns round i pray you tell me what you meant by that a very mean meaning and i am mean indeed respecting you what is your will sir that you send for me they sit conferring by the parlor fire fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable a woman moved is like a fountain troubled muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts come come you froward and unable worms my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are then vail your stomachs for it is no boot and place your hands below your husbands foot in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him easemates maid how mean you that no mates for you unless you were of gentler milder mould signior baptista will you be so strange sorry am i that our good will effects biancas grief so will i signior gremio but a word i pray though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in biancos love to labour and effect one thing specially marry sir to get a husband for her sister i say a husband tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough faith as you say theres small choice in rotten apples but come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintained all by helping baptistas eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have tot a fresh sweet bianca happy man be his dole he that runs

beautiful binaca and her withholds from me and other more suitors to her and rivals in my love supposing it a thing impossible for those defects i have before rehearsed that ever katharina will be wood therefore this order hath baptista taen that none shall have access unto bianca till katharina the curst have got a husband now shall my friend petruchio do me grace and offer me disguised in sober robes to old baptista as a schoolmaster well seen in music to instruct bianca that so i may by this device at least have leave and leisure to make love to her and unsuspected court her by herself peace grumio it is the rival of my love petruchio stand by a while grumio mum god save you signior gremio tis well and i have met a gentleman hath promised me to help me to another a fine

chapeless with two broken points his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten nearlegged before and with a halfchequed bit and a headstall of sheeps leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six time pieced and a womans crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthread o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies pricked int for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian footboy or a gentlemans lackey why sir he comes not who that petruchio came no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back nay by saint jamy i hold you a penny a
