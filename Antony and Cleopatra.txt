make my countrys high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains say i would die i cannot tell no matter sir what i have heard or known you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams ist not your trick i dreamd there was an emperor antony o such another sleep that i might see but such another man his face was as the heavens and therein stuck a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted the little o the earth his legs bestrid the ocean his reard arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder for his bounty there was no winter int an autumn twas that grew the more by reaping his delights were dolphinlike they showd his back above the element they lived in in his livery walkd crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates droppd from his pocket think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamd of you lie up to the hearing of the gods but if there be or ever were one such its past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet to imagine and antony were natures piece gainst fancy condemning shadows quite i thank you sir know you what caesar means to do with me nay pray you sir hell lead me then in triumph sir the gods will have it thus my master and my lord i must obey sole sir o the world i cannot project mine own cause so well to make it clear but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamed our sex and may through all the world tis yours and we your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall hang in what place you please here my good lord this is the brief of money plate and jewels i am possessd of tis exactly valued not petty things admitted

shalt go back i warrant thee but ill catch thine eyes though they had wings slave soulless villain dog o rarely base o caesar what a wounding shame is this that thou vouchsafing here to visit me doing the honour of thy lordliness to one so meek that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy say good caesar that i some lady trifles have reserved immoment toys things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal and say some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia to induce their mediation must i be unfolded with one that i have bred the gods it smites me beneath the fall i have   prithee go hence or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man thou wouldst have mercy on me be it known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others merits in our name are therefore to be pitied my master and my lord he words me girls he words me that i should not be noble to myself but hark thee charmian hie thee again i have spoke already and it is provided go put it to the haste dolabella dolabella i shall remain your debtor farewell and thanks   now

not so which is mark antony he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here i shall take it sir we have used our throats in egypt not till you have slept i fear me youll be in till then heres to thee menas theres a strong fellow menas a bears the third part of the world man seest not drink thou increase the reels ho says a theres my cap they have dispatchd with pompey he is gone the other three are sealing octavia weeps to part from rome caesar is sad and lepidus since pompeys feast as menas says is troubled with the green sickness caesar why hes the jupiter of men spake you of caesar how the nonpareil would you praise caesar say caesar go no further but he loves caesar best yet he loves antony ho hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets cannot think speak cast write sing number ho his love to antony but as for caesar kneel down kneel down and wonder aside to agrippa  will caesar weep aside to agrippa  he were the worse for that were he a horse so is he being a man aside to agrippa  that year indeed he was troubled with a rheum what willingly he did confound he waild believet till i wept too how now friend eros what man this is old what is the success then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more and throw between them all the food thou hast theyll grind the one the other wheres antony our great navys riggd but why why why well is it is it so hath my lord dared him to single fight that i beheld mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view alack alack ay are you thereabouts why then good night indeed think and die antony only that would make his will lord of his reason what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other why should he follow the itch of his affection should not then have nickd his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the meered question twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing aside  yes like enough highbattled caesar will unstate his happiness and be staged to the show against a sworder i see mens judgments are a parcel of their fortunes and things outward do draw the inward quality after them to suffer all alike that he should dream knowing all measures the full caesar will answer his emptiness caesar thou hast subdued his judgment too he needs as many sir as caesar has or needs not us if caesar please our master will leap to be his friend for us you know whose he is we are and that is caesars aside             to be sure of that i will ask antony sir sir thou art so leaky that we must leave thee to thy sinking for thy dearest quit thee aside  tis better playing with a lions whelp than with an old one dying now hell outstare the lightning to be furious is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge and i see still a diminution in our captains brain restores his heart when valour preys on reason it eats the sword it fights with i will seek some way to leave him no aside to cleopatra  tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots out of the mind aside to cleopatra  to make his followers weep what mean you sir to give them this discomfort look they weep and i an ass am onioneyed for shame transform us not to women alexas did revolt and went to jewry on affairs of antony there did persuade great

thou browsedst on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lankd not till which encounter it is my business too farewell i do not know mecaenas ask agrippa welcome to rome sit nay then i must be laughd at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i the world more laughd at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concernd me no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befal me your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patchd up your excuses i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech fort cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so differing in their acts yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge o the world i would pursue it speak agrippa say not so agrippa if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness not till he hears how antony is touchd with what is spoke already the power of caesar and his power unto octavia there is my hand a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master take your time and what may follow to try a larger fortune since i saw you last there is a change upon you thats the next to do will this description satisfy him possess it ill make answer but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one i have said farewell my dearest sister fare thee well the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort fare thee well what octavia adieu be happy contemning rome he has done all this and more in alexandria heres the manner of t i the marketplace on a tribunal silverd cleopatra and himself in

stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen i the common showplace where they exercise his sons he there proclaimd the kings of kings great media parthia and armenia he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assignd syria cilicia and phoenicia she in the habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeard and oft before gave audience as tis reported so the people know it and have now received his accusations caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoild we had not rated him his part o the isle then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue tis done already and the messenger gone i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change for what i have conquerd i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquerd kingdoms i demand the like nor must not then be yielded to in this that ever i should call thee castaway why have you stoln upon us thus you come not like caesars sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear the trees by the way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a marketmaid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting which soon he granted being an obstruct tween his lust and him i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind where is he now no my most wronged sister cleopatra hath nodded him to her he hath given his empire up to a whore who now are levying the kings o the earth for war he hath assembled bocchus the king of libya archelaus of cappadocia

that served mark antony but late enough to fetch him in see it done and feast the army we have store to dot and they have earnd the waste poor antony the time of universal peace is near prove this a prosperous day the threenookd world shall bear the olive freely go charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the van that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself go to him dolabella bid him yield being so frustrate tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes what ist thou sayst the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom in the name lay a moiety of the world look you sad friends the gods rebuke me but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings o antony i have followd thee to this but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that thou my brother my competitor in top of all design my mate in empire friend and companion in the front of war the arm of mine own body and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindlethat our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this hear me good friends but i will tell you at some meeter season   the business of this man looks out of him well hear him what he says whence are you bid her have good heart she soon shall know of us by some of ours how honourable and how kindly we determine for her for

still in all my writings go with me and see what i can show in this take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a benefit in this change but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking antonys course you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes and put your children to that destruction which ill guard them from if thereon you rely ill take my leave you shall
