you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods no more obey the heavens than our courtiers still seem as does the king his daughter and the heir ofs kingdom whom he purposed to his wifes sole sona widow that late he marriedhath referrd herself unto a poor but worthy gentleman shes wedded her husband banishd she imprisond all is outward sorrow though i think the king be touchd at very heart he that hath lost her too so is the queen that most desired the match but not a courtier although they wear their faces to the bent of the kings looks hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at you speak him far i do extend him sir within himself crush him together rather than unfold his measure duly whats his name and birth how long is this ago some twenty years that a kings children should be so conveyd so slackly guarded and the search so slow that could not trace them i do well believe you we must forbear here comes the gentleman the queen and princessbut whats the matter none but the king and why so i honour him even out of your report but pray you tell me is she sole child to the kinghe that hath missd the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her i mean that married her alack good man and therefore banishdis a creature such as to seek through the regions of the earth for one his like there would be something failing in him that should compare i do not think so fair an outward and such stuff within endows a man but he i cannot delve him to the root his father was calld sicilius who did join his honour against the romans with cassibelan but had his titles by tenantius whom he served with glory and admired success so gaind the suraddition leonatus and had besides this gentleman in question two other sons who in the wars o the time died with their swords in hand for which their father then old and fond of issue took such sorrow that he quit being and his gentle lady big of this gentleman our theme deceased as he was born the king he takes the babe to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber puts to him all the learnings that his time could make him the receiver of which he took as we do air fast as twas ministerd and ins spring became a harvest lived in court which rare it is to domost praised most loved a sample to the youngest to the more mature a glass that feated them and to the graver a child that guided dotards to his mistress for whom he now is banishd her own price proclaims how she esteemd him and his virtue by her election may be truly read what kind of man he is his only child he had two sons if this be worth your hearing mark it the eldest of them at three years old i the swathingclothes the other from their nursery were stoln and to this hour no guess in knowledge which way they went howsoeer tis strange or that the negligence may well be laughd at yet is it true sirno be assured you shall not find me daughter after the slander of most stepmothers evileyed unto you youre my prisoner but your gaoler shall deliver you the keys that lock up your restraint for you posthumus so soon as i can win the offended king i will be known your advocate marry

affections though the king hath charged you should not speak together be brief i pray you if the king come i shall incur i know not how much of his displeasure   yet ill move him to walk this way i

having thus far proceeded unless thou thinkst me devilishist not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging but none human to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects o content thee     here comes a flattering rascal upon him will i first work hes for his master an enemy to my son how now pisanio doctor your service for this time is ended take your own way to pisanio            hark thee a word no further service doctor until i send for thee weeps she still sayst thou dost thou think in time she will not quench and let instructions enter where folly now possesses do thou work when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son ill tell thee on the instant thou art then as great as is thy master greater for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name is at last gasp return he cannot nor continue where he is to shift his being is to exchange one misery with another and every day that comes comes to decay a days work in him what shalt thou expect to be depender on a thing that leans who cannot be new built nor has no friends so much as but to prop him   thou takest up thou knowst not what but take it for thy labour it is a thing i made which hath the king five times redeemd from death i do not know what is more cordial nay i prethee take it it is an earnest of a further good that i mean to thee tell thy mistress how the case stands with her dot as from thyself think what a chance thou changest on but think thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son who shall take notice of thee ill move the king to any shape of thy preferment such as thoult desire and then myself i chiefly that set thee on to

frame yourself to orderly soliciting and be friended with aptness of the season make denials increase your services so seem as if you were inspired to do those duties which you tender to her that you in all obey her save when command to your dismission tends and therein you are senseless and to kill the marvel shall be so ever that opportunity which then they had to take from s to resume we have again remember sir my liege the kings your ancestors together with the natural bravery of your isle which stands as neptunes park ribbed and paled in with rocks unscalable and roaring waters with sands that will not bear your enemies boats but suck them up to the topmast a kind of conquest caesar made here but made not here his brag of came and saw and overcame  with shame that first that ever touchd himhe was carried from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping poor ignorant baubles upon our terrible seas like eggshells moved upon their surges crackd as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof the famed cassibelan who was once at point o giglot fortuneto master caesars sword made luds town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage and you he goes hence frowning but it honours us that we have given him cause tis not sleepy business but must be lookd to speedily and strongly royal sir since the exile of posthumus most retired hath her life been the cure whereof my lord tis time must do beseech your majesty forbear sharp speeches to her shes a lady so tender of rebukes that words are strokes and strokes death to her my lord when last i went to visit her she prayd me to excuse her keeping close whereto constraind by her infirmity she should that duty leave unpaid to you which daily she was bound to proffer this she wishd me to make known but our great court made me to blame in memory son i say follow the king go look after   pisanio thou that standst so for posthumus he hath a drug of mine i pray his absence proceed by swallowing that for he believes it is a thing most precious but for her where is she gone haply despair hath seized her or wingd with fervor of her love shes flown to her desired posthumus gone she is to death or to dishonour and my end can make good use of either she being down i have the placing of the british crown   how now my son aside            all the better may this night forestall him of the coming

he swears by jupiter he swears tis truenay keep the ringtis true i am sure she would not lose it her attendants are all sworn and honourablethey induced to steal it and by a strangerno he hath enjoyed her the cognizance of her incontinency is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell divide themselves between you never talk ont she hath been colted by him ay and it doth confirm another stain as big as hell can hold were there no more but it is there no way for men to be but women must be halfworkers we are all bastards and that most venerable man which i did call my father was i know not where when i was stampd some coiner with his tools made me a counterfeit yet my mother seemd the dian of that time so doth my wife the nonpareil of this o vengeance vengeance me of my lawful pleasure she restraind and prayd me oft forbearance did it with a pudency so rosy the sweet view ont might well have warmd old saturn that i thought her as chaste as unsunnd snow o all the devils this yellow iachimo in an hourwast not or lessat firstperchance he spoke not but like a fullacornd boar a german one cried o and mounted found no opposition but what he lookd for should oppose and she should from encounter guard could i find out the womans part in me for theres no motion that tends to vice in man but i affirm it is the womans part be it lying note it the womans flattering hers deceiving hers lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers ambitions covetings change of prides disdain nice longing slanders mutability all faults that may be named nay that hell knows why hers in part or all but rather all for even to vice they are not constant but are changing still one vice but of a minute old for one not half so old as that ill write against them detest them curse them yet tis greater skill in a true hate to pray they have their will the very devils cannot plague them better yea bloody cloth ill keep thee for i wishd thou shouldst be colourd thus you married ones if each of you should take this course how many must murder wives much better than themselves for wrying but a little o pisanio every good servant does not all commands no bond but to do just ones gods if you should have taen vengeance on my faults i never had lived to put on this so had you saved the noble imogen to repent and struck me wretch more worth your vengeance but alack you snatch some hence for little faults thats love to have them fall no more you some permit to second ills with ills each elder worse and make them dread it to the doers thrift but imogen is your own do your best wills and make me blest to obey i am brought hither among the italian gentry and to fight against my ladys kingdom tis enough that britain i have killd thy mistress peace ill give no wound to thee therefore good heavens hear patiently my purpose ill disrobe me of these italian weeds and suit myself as does a briton peasant so ill fight against the part i come with so ill die for thee o imogen even for whom my life is every breath a death and thus unknown pitied nor hated to the face of peril myself ill dedicate let me make men know more valour in me than my habits show gods put the strength o the leonati in me to shame the guise o the world i will begin the fashion less without and more within i did though you it seems come from the fliers no blame be to you sir for all was lost but that the heavens fought the king himself of his wings destitute the army broken and but the backs of britons seen all flying through a straight lane the enemy fullhearted lolling the tongue with slaughtering having work more plentiful than tools to dot struck down some mortally some slightly touchd some falling merely through fear that the straight pass was dammd with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with lengthend shame nay do not wonder at it you are made rather to wonder at the things you hear than to work any will you rhyme upont and vent it for a mockery here is one two boys an old man twice a boy a lane preserved the britons was the romans bane lack to what end who dares not stand his foe ill be his friend for if hell do as he is made to do i know hell quickly fly my friendship too you have put me into rhyme still going   this is a lord o noble misery to be i the field and ask what news of me today how many would have given their honours to have saved their carcasses took heel to dot and yet died too i in mine own woe charmd could not find death where i did hear him groan nor feel him where he struck being an ugly monster tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds sweet words or hath more ministers than we that draw his knives i the war well i will find him for being now a favourer to the briton no more a briton i have resumed again the part i came in fight i will no more but yield me to the veriest hind that shall once touch my shoulder great the slaughter is here made by the roman great the answer be britons must take for me my ransoms death on either side i come to spend my breath which neither here ill keep nor bear again but end it by some means for imogen overroasted rather ready long ago so if i prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot i am merrier to die than thou art to live yes indeed do i fellow i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way i am going but such as wink and will not use them thou bringst good news i am called to be made free aside                 whats that to him advancing             ay so thou dost italian fiend ay me most credulous fool egregious murderer thief any thing thats due to all the villains past in being to come o give me cord or knife or poison some upright justicer thou king send out for torturers ingenious it is i that all the abhorred things o the earth amend by being worse than they i am posthumus that killd thy daughtervillainlike i lie that caused a lesser villain than myself a sacrilegious thief to dot the temple of virtue was she yea and she herself spit and throw stone s cast mire upon me set the dogs o the street to bay me every villain be calld posthumus leonitus and be villany less than twas o imogen my queen my life my wife o imogen imogen imogen shalls have a play of this thou scornful page there lie thy part how come these staggers on me i am sir the soldier that

tyrant can tickle where she wounds my dearest husband i something fear my fathers wrath but nothing always reserved my holy dutywhat his rage can do on me you must be gone and i shall here abide the hourly shot of angry eyes not comforted to live but that there is this jewel in the world that i may see again nay stay a little were you but riding forth to air yourself such parting were too petty look here love this diamond was my mothers take it heart but keep it till you woo another wife when imogen is dead o the gods when shall we see again there cannot be a pinch in death more sharp than this is i beseech you sir harm not yourself with your vexation i am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare subdues all pangs all fears past hope and in despair that way past grace o blest that i might not i chose an eagle and did avoid a puttock no i rather added a lustre to it sir it is your fault that i have loved posthumus you bred him as my playfellow and he is a man worth any woman overbuys me almost the sum he pays almost sir heaven restore me would i were a neatherds daughter and my leonatus our neighbour shepherds son your sons my fathers friend he takes his part to draw upon an exile o brave sir i would they were in afric both together myself by with a needle that i might prick the goerback why came you from your master about some halfhour hence i pray you speak with me

offerd mercy is what was the last that he spake to thee then waved his handkerchief senseless linen happier therein than i and that was all thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to aftereye him i would have broke mine eyestrings crackd them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followd him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turnd mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour or have charged him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight to encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the

health of his content yet not that we two are asunder let that grieve him some griefs are medcinable that is one of them for it doth physic love of his content all but in that good wax thy leave blest be you bees that make these locks of counsel lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike though forfeiters you cast in prison yet you clasp young cupids tables good news gods   justice and your fathers wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you o the dearest of creatures would even renew me with your eyes take notice that i am in cambria at milfordhaven what your own love will out of this advise you follow so he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love leonatus posthumus o for a horse with wings hearst thou pisanio he is at milfordhaven read and tell me how far tis thither if one of mean affairs may plod it in a week why may not i glide thither in a day then true pisanio who longst like me to see thy lord who longst let me batebut not like meyet longst but in a fainter kindo not like me for mines beyond beyondsay and speak thick loves counsellor should fill the bores of hearing to the smothering of the sensehow far it is to this same blessed milford and by the way tell me how wales was made so happy as to inherit such a haven but first of all how we may steal from hence and for the gap that we shall make in time from our hencegoing and our return to excuse but first how get hence why should excuse be born or eer begot well talk of that hereafter prithee speak how many score of miles may we well ride twixt hour and hour why one that rode tos execution man could never go so slow i have heard of riding wagers where horses have been nimbler than the sands that run i the clocks behalf but this is foolery go bid my woman feign a sickness say shell home to her father and provide me presently a ridingsuit no costlier than would fit a franklins housewife i see before me man nor here nor here nor what ensues but have a fog in them that i cannot look through away i prithee do as i bid thee theres no more to say accessible is none but milford way thou toldst me when we came from horse the place was near at hand neer longd my mother so to see me first as i have now pisanio man where is posthumus what is in thy mind that makes thee stare thus wherefore breaks that sigh from the inward of thee one but painted thus would be interpreted a thing perplexd beyond selfexplication put thyself into a havior of less fear ere wildness vanquish my staider senses whats the matter why tenderst thou that paper to me with a look untender ift be summer news smile tot before if winterly thou needst but keep that countenance still my husbands hand that drugdamnd italy hath outcraftied him and hes at some hard point speak man thy tongue may take off some extremity which to read would be even mortal to me reads  thy mistress pisanio hath played the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me i speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as i expect my revenge that part thou pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers let thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity at milfordhaven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal false to his bed what is it to be false to lie in watch there and to think on him to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake thats false tos bed is it i false thy conscience witness iachimo thou didst accuse him of incontinency thou then lookdst like a villain now methinks thy favours good enough some jay of italy whose mother was her painting hath betrayd him poor i am stale a garment out of fashion and for i am richer than to hang by the walls i must be rippdto pieces with meo mens vows are womens traitors all good seeming by thy revolt o husband shall be thought put on for villany not born wheret grows but worn a bait for ladies true honest men being heard like false aeneas were in his time thought false and sinons weeping did scandal many a holy tear took pity from most true wretchedness so thou posthumus wilt lay the leaven on all proper men goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured from thy great fall come fellow be thou honest do thou thy masters bidding when thou seest him a little witness my obedience look i draw the sword myself take it and hit the innocent mansion of my love my heart fear not tis empty of all things but grief thy master is not there who was indeed the riches of it do his bidding strike thou mayst be valiant in a better cause but now thou seemst a coward why i must die and if i do not by thy hand thou art no servant of thy masters against selfslaughter there is a prohibition so divine that cravens my weak hand come heres my heart somethings aforet soft soft well no defence obedient as the scabbard what is here the scriptures of the loyal leonatus all turnd to heresy away away corrupters of my faith you shall no more be stomachers to my heart thus may poor fools believe false teachers though those that are betrayd do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor stands in worse case of woe and thou posthumus thou that didst set up my disobedience gainst the king my father and make me put into contempt the suits of princely fellows shalt hereafter find it is no act of common passage but a strain of rareness and i grieve myself to think when thou shalt be disedged by her that now thou tirest on how thy memory will then be pangd by me prithee dispatch the lamb entreats the butcher wheres thy knife thou art too slow to do thy masters bidding when i desire it too dot and to bed then wherefore then didst undertake it why hast thou abused so many miles with a pretence this place mine action and thine own our horses labour the time inviting thee the perturbd court for my being absent whereunto i never purpose return why hast thou gone so far to be unbent when thou hast taen thy stand the elected deer before thee talk thy tongue weary speak i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear therein false struck can take no greater wound nor tent to bottom that but speak most like bringing me here to kill me some roman courtezan why good fellow what shall i do the where where bide how live or in my life what comfort when i am dead to my husband no court no father nor no more ado with that harsh noble simple nothing that cloten whose lovesuit hath been to me as fearful as a siege where then hath britain all the sun that shines day night are they not but in britain i the worlds volume our britain seems as of it but not in t in a great pool a swans nest prithee think theres livers out of britain o for such means though peril to my modesty not death ont i would adventure nay be brief i see into thy end and am almost a man already thou art all the comfort the gods will diet me with prithee away theres more to be considerd but well even all that good time will give us this attempt i am soldier to and will abide it with a princes courage away i prithee amen i thank thee i see a mans life is a tedious one i have tired myself and for two nights together have made the ground my bed i should be sick but that my resolution helps me milford when from the mountaintop pisanio showd thee thou wast within a ken o jove i think foundations fly the wretched such i mean where they should be relieved two beggars told me i could not miss my way will poor folks lie that have afflictions on them knowing tis a punishment or trial yes no wonder when rich ones scarce tell true to lapse in fulness is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood is worse in kings than beggars my dear lord thou art one o the false ones now i think on thee my hungers gone but even before i was at point to sink for food but what is this here is a path tot tis some savage hold i were best not to call i dare not call yet famine ere clean it oerthrow nature makes it

forespent on us we must extend our notice our dear son when you have given good morning to your mistress attend the queen and us we shall have need to employ you towards this roman come our queen now say what would augustus caesar with us son let your mother end you must know till the injurious romans did extort this tribute from us we were free caesars ambition which swelld so much that it did almost stretch the sides o the world against all colour here did put the yoke upon s which to shake off becomes a warlike people whom we reckon ourselves to be say then to caesar our ancestor was that mulmutius which ordaind our laws whose use the sword of caesar hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise shall by the power we hold be our good deed though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws who was the first of britain which did put his brows within a golden crown and calld himself a king thou art welcome caius thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent much under him of him i gatherd honour which he to seek of me again perforce behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect that the pannonians and dalmatians for their liberties are now in arms a precedent which not to read would show the britons cold so caesar shall not find them i know your masters pleasure and he mine all the remain is welcome thus far and so farewell our subjects sir will not endure his yoke and for ourself to show less sovereignty than they must needs appear unkinglike my lords you are appointed for that office the due of honour in no point omit so farewell noble lucius leave not the worthy lucius good my lords till he have crossd the severn happiness lucius hath wrote already to the emperor how it goes here it fits us therefore ripely our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness the powers that he already hath in gallia will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves his war for britain our expectation that it would be thus hath made us forward but my gentle queen where is our daughter she hath not appeard before the roman nor to us hath tenderd the duty of the day she looks us like a thing more made of malice than of duty we have noted it call her before us for we have been too slight in sufferance where is she sir how can her contempt be answerd her doors lockd not seen of late grant heavens that which i fear prove false again and bring me word how tis with her   a fever with the absence of her son a madness of which her lifes in danger heavens how deeply you at once do touch me imogen the great part of my comfort gone my queen upon a desperate bed and in a time when fearful wars point at me her son gone so needful for this present it strikes me past the hope of comfort but for thee fellow who needs must know of her departure and dost seem so ignorant well

you lets withdraw and meet the time as it seeks us we fear not what can from italy annoy us but we grieve at chances here away stand by my side you whom the gods have made preservers of my throne woe

the most coldest that ever turned up ace here comes the king so please your majesty the roman legions all from gallia drawn are landed on your coast with a supply of roman gentlemen by the senate sent camest thou from where they made the stand i did where was this lane this was strange chance a narrow lane an old man and two boys nay be not angry sir farewell youre angrythe queen madam desires your highness company please you madam almost midnight madam whos there that knocks no more thats more than some whose tailors are as dear as yours can justly boast of whats your lordships pleasure ay to keep her chamber how my good name or to report of you what i shall think is goodthe princessbelieve it sir i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but i could then have looked on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items this matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality but how comes it he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintance can we with manners ask what was the difference that lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this worn out you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy as fair and as gooda kind of handinhand comparisonhad been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady what do you esteem it at either your unparagoned mistress is dead or shes outprized by a trifle which the gods have given you you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplished courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion oervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world whats that would i had put my estate and my neighbours on the approbation of what i have spoke yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved you are afraid and therein the wiser if you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear i am the master of my speeches and would undergo whats spoken i swear by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment your hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded change you madam the worthy leonatus is in safety and greets your highness dearly aside  all of her that is out of door most rich if she be furnishd with a mind so rare she is alone the arabian bird and i have lost the wager boldness be my friend arm me audacity from head to foot or like the parthian i shall flying fight rather directly fly thanks fairest lady what are men mad hath nature given them eyes to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop of sea and land which can distinguish twixt the fiery orbs above and the twinnd stones upon the numberd beach and can we not partition make with spectacles so precious twixt fair and foul it cannot be i the eye for apes and monkeys twixt two such shes would chatter this way and contemn with mows the other nor i the judgment for idiots in this case of favour would be wisely definite nor i the appetite sluttery to such neat excellence opposed should make desire vomit emptiness not so allured to feed the cloyed will that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub both filld and running ravening first the lamb longs after for the garbage thanks madam well   beseech you sir desire my mans abode where i did leave him he is strange and peevish well madam exceeding pleasant none a stranger there so merry and so gamesome he is calld the briton reveller i never saw him sad there is a frenchman his companion one an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves a gallian girl at home he furnaces the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton your lord i meanlaughs froms free lungs cries o can my sides hold to think that man who knows by history report or his own proof what woman is yea what she cannot choose but must be will his free hours languish for assured bondage ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter it is a recreation to be by and hear him mock the frenchman but heavens know some men are much to blame not he but yet heavens bounty towards him might be used more thankfully in himself tis much in you which i account his beyond all talents whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound to pity too two creatures heartily lamentable what to hide me from the radiant sun and solace i the dungeon by a snuff that others do i was about to sayenjoy yourbut it is an office of the gods to venge it not mine to speak on t had i this cheek to bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch whose every touch would force the feelers soul to the oath of loyalty this object which takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye fixing it only here should i damnd then slaver with lips as common as the stairs that mount the capitol join gripes with hands made hard with hourly falsehoodfalsehood as with labour then bypeeping in an eye base and unlustrous as the smoky light thats fed with stinking tallow it were fit that all the plagues of hell should at one time encounter such revolt and himself not i inclined to this intelligence pronounce the beggary of his change but tis your graces that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue charms this report out o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart with pity that doth make me sick a lady so fair and fastend to an empery would make the greatst king doubleto be

ramps in your despite upon your purse revenge it i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure more noble than that runagate to your bed and will continue fast to your affection still close as sure let me my service tender on your lips o happy leonatus i may say the credit that thy lady hath of thee deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness her assured credit blessed live you long a lady to the worthiest sir that ever country calld his and you his mistress only for the most worthiest fit give me your pardon i have spoke this to know if your affiance were deeply rooted and shall make your

might touch but kiss one kiss rubies unparagond how dearly they dot tis her breathing that perfumes the chamber thus the flame o the taper bows toward her and would underpeep her lids to see the enclosed lights now canopied under these windows white and azure laced with blue of heavens own tinct but my design to note the chamber i will write all down such and such pictures there the window such the adornment of her bed the arras figures why such and such and the contents o the story ah but some natural notes about her body above ten thousand meaner moveables would testify to enrich mine inventory o sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her and be her sense but as a monument thus in a chapel lying come off come off   as slippery as the gordian knot was hard tis mine and this will witness outwardly as strongly as the conscience does within to the madding of her lord on her left breast a mole cinquespotted like the crimson drops i the bottom of a cowslip heres a voucher stronger than ever law could make this secret will force him think i have pickd the lock and taen the treasure of her honour no more to what end why should i write this down thats riveted screwd to my memory

the press of boats or pride a piece of work so bravely done so rich that it did strive in workmanship and value which i wonderd could be so rarely and exactly wrought since the true life ont was more particulars must justify my knowledge the chimney is south the chamber and the chimneypiece chaste dian bathing never saw i figures so likely to report themselves the cutter was as another nature dumb outwent her motion and breath left out the roof o the chamber with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons i had forgot themwere two winking cupids of silver each on one foot standing nicely depending on their brands then if you can   be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see and now tis up again it must be married to that your diamond ill keep them siri thank herthat she strippd it from her arm i see her yet her pretty action did outsell her gift and yet enrichd it too she gave it me and said she prized it once she writes so to you doth she by jupiter i had it from her arm if

this country and the air ont revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl a very drudge of natures have subdued me in my profession knighthoods and honours borne as i wear mine are titles but of scorn if that thy gentry britain go before this lout as he exceeds our lords the odds is that we scarce are men and you are gods tis their fresh supplies thoult torture me to leave unspoken that which to be

a timeunhappy was the clock that struck the hourit was in romeaccursed the mansion wheretwas at a feasto would our viands had been poisond or at least those which i heaved to headthe good posthumus what should i say he was too good to be where ill men were and was the best of all amongst the rarest of good onessitting sadly hearing us praise our loves of italy for beauty that made barren the swelld boast of him that best could speak for feature laming the shrine of venus or straightpight minerva postures beyond brief nature for condition a shop of all the qualities that man loves woman for besides that hook of wiving fairness which strikes the eye all too soon i shall unless thou wouldst grieve quickly this posthumus most like a noble lord in love and one that had a royal lover took his hint and not dispraising whom we praisedtherein he was as calm as virtuehe began his mistress picture which by his tongue being made and then a mind put int either our brags were crackd of kitchentrolls or his description proved us unspeaking sots your daughters chastitythere it begins he spake of her as dian had hot dreams and she alone were cold whereat i wretch made scruple of his praise and wagerd with him pieces of gold gainst this which then he wore upon his honourd finger to attain in suit the place ofs bed and win this ring by hers and mine adultery he true knight no lesser of her honour confident than i did truly find her stakes this ring and would so had it been a carbuncle of phoebus wheel and might so safely had it been all the worth ofs car away to britain post i in this design well may you sir remember me at court where i was taught of your chaste daughter the wide difference twixt amorous and villanous being thus quenchd of hope not longing mine italian brain gan in your duller britain operate most vilely for my vantage excellent and to be brief my practise so prevaild that i returnd with simular proof enough to make the noble leonatus mad by wounding his belief in her renown with tokens thus and thus averting notes of chamberhanging pictures this her bracelet o cunning how i got itnay some marks of secret on her person that he could not but think her bond of chastity quite crackd i having taen the forfeit whereupon methinks i see him now kneeling          i am down again but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee as then your force did take that life beseech you which i so often owe but your ring first and here the bracelet of the truest princess that ever swore her faithyou speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within his father and i were soldiers together to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality   i beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing let us leave here gentlemen gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted i will have it no lay signior iachimo will not from it pray let us follow em what means do you make to him your very goodness and your company oerpays all i can do by this your king hath heard of great augustus caius lucius will dos commission throughly and i think hell grant the tribute send the arrearages or look upon our romans whose remembrance is yet fresh in their grief see iachimo welcome sir was caius lucius in the britain court when you were there have patience sir and take your ring again tis not yet won it may be probable she lost it or who knows if one of her women being corrupted hath stoln it from her sir be patient this is not strong enough to be believed of one persuaded well of quite besides the government of patience you have won lets follow him and pervert the present wrath he hath against himselfi have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he and then his banishment sir we have known together in orleans sir you oerrate my poor kindness i was glad i did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fallen both safely i think twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouchingand upon warrant of bloody affirmationhis to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constantqualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france will this hold think youi madam we did so please your highnesspleaseth your highness ay here they are madam   but i beseech your grace without offence my conscience bids me askwherefore you have commanded of me those most poisonous compounds which are the movers of a languishing death but though slow deadly your highness shall from this practise but make hard your heart besides the seeing these effects will be both noisome and infectious aside          i do suspect you madam but you shall do no harm aside  i do not like her she doth think she has strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit and will not trust one of her malice with a drug of such damnd nature those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile which first perchance shell prove on cats and dogs then afterward up higher but there is no danger in what show of death it makes more than the lockingup the spirits a time to be more fresh reviving she is foold with a most false effect and i the truer so to be false with her i humbly take my leave hail great king to sour your happiness i must report the queen is dead with horror madly dying like her life which being cruel to the world concluded most cruel to herself what she confessd i will report so please you these her women can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks were present when she finishd first she confessd she never loved you only affected greatness got by you not you married your royalty was wife to your place abhorrd your person your daughter whom she bore in hand to love with such integrity she did confess was as a scorpion to her sight whose life but that her flight prevented it she had taen off by poison more sir and worse she did confess she had for you a mortal mineral which being took should by the minute feed on life and lingering by inches waste you in which time she purposed by watching weeping tendance kissing to oercome you with her show and in time when she had fitted you with her craft to work her son into the adoption of the crown but failing of her end by his strange absence grew shamelessdesperate opend in despite of heaven and men her purposes repented the evils she hatchd were not effected so despairing died o gods i left out one thing which the queen confessd which must approve thee honest if pisanio have said she given his mistress that confection which i gave him for cordial she is served as i would serve a rat the queen sir very oft importuned me to temper poisons for her still pretending the satisfaction of her knowledge only in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs of no esteem i dreading that her purpose was of more danger did compound for her a certain stuff which being taen would cease the present power of life but in short time all offices of nature should again do their due functions have you taen of it by the queens dram she swallowdan antechamber adjoining imogens apartmentsso like you sir ambassadors from rome the one is caius lucius knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the kingwhen

you for this time go in and rest pray be not sick for you must be our housewife and shalt be ever   this youth hower distressd appears he hath had good ancestors it is great morning come away whos there those runagates means he not us i partly know him tis cloten the son o the queen i fear some ambush i saw him not these many years and yet i know tis he we are held as outlaws hence no companies abroad i cannot tell long is it since i saw him but time hath nothing blurrd those lines of favour which then he wore the snatches in his voice and burst of speaking were as his i am absolute twas very cloten being scarce made up i mean to man he had not apprehension of roaring terrors for the effect of judgment is oft the cause of fear but see thy brother what hast thou done we are all undone no single soul can we set eye on but in all safe reason he must have some attendants though his humour was nothing but mutation ay and that from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not absolute madness could so far have raved to bring him here alone although perhaps it may be heard at court that such as we cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time may make some stronger head the which he hearing as it is like himmight break out and swear held fetch us in yet ist not probable to come alone either he so undertaking or they so suffering then on good ground we fear if we do fear this body hath a tail more perilous than the head i had no mind to hunt this day the boy fideles sickness did make my way long forth i fear twill be revenged would polydote thou hadst not donet though valour becomes thee well enough well tis done well hunt no more today nor seek for danger where theres no profit i prithee to our rock you and fidele play the cooks ill stay till hasty polydote return and bring him to dinner presently o thou goddess thou divine nature how thyself thou blazonst in these two princely boys they are as gentle as zephyrs blowing below the violet not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough their royal blood enchafed as the rudest wind that by the top doth take the mountain pine and make him stoop to the vale tis wonder that an invisible instinct should frame them to royalty unlearnd honour untaught civility not seen from other valour that wildly grows in them but yields a crop as if it had been sowd yet still its strange what clotens being here to us portends or what his death will bring us my ingenious instrument hark polydore it sounds but what occasion hath cadwal now to give it motion hark he went hence even now look here he comes and brings the dire occasion in his arms of what we blame him for o melancholy who ever yet could sound thy bottom find the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare might easiliest harbour in thou blessed thing jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy how found you him great griefs i see medicine the less for cloten is quite forgot he was a queens son boys and though he came our enemy remember he was paid for that though mean and mighty rotting together have one dust yet reverence that angel of the world doth make distinction of place tween high and low our foe was princely and though you took his life as being our foe yet bury him as a prince heres a few flowers but bout midnight more the herbs that have on them cold dew o the night are strewings fittst for graves upon their faces you were as flowers now witherd even so these herblets shall which we upon you strew come on away apart upon our knees the ground that gave them first has them again their pleasures here are past so is their pain let us from it sons well higher to the mountains there secure us to the kings party theres no going newness of clotens deathwe being not known not musterd among the bandsmay drive us to a render where we have lived and so extort froms that which we have done whose answer would be death drawn on with torture o i am known of many in the army many years though cloten then but young you see not wore him from my remembrance and besides the king hath not deserved my service nor your loves who find in my exile the want of breeding the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless to have the courtesy your cradle promised but to be still hot summers tamings and the shrinking slaves of winter no reason i since of your lives you set so slight a valuation should reserve my crackd one to more care have with you boys if in your country wars you chance to die that is my bed too lads an there ill lie lead lead   the time seems long their blood thinks scorn till it fly

they hear the roman horses neigh behold their quarterd fires have both their eyes and ears so cloyd importantly as now that they will waste their time upon our note to know from whence we are by this sun that shines ill thither what thing is it that i never did see man die scarce ever lookd on blood but that of coward hares hot goats and venison never bestrid a horse save one that had a rider like myself who neer wore rowel nor iron on his heel i am ashamed to look upon the holy sun to have the benefit of his blest beams remaining so long a poor unknown so say iamen stand stand and fight one

lucius is taken tis thought the old man and his sons were angelslast night the very gods showd me a vision i fast and prayd for their intelligencethus i saw joves bird the roman eagle wingd from the spongy south to this part of the west there vanishd in the sunbeams which portends unless my sins abuse my divination success to the roman host here my good lord reads  when as a lions whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embraced by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty thou leonatus art the lions whelp the fit and apt construction of thy name being leonatus doth import so much   the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter which we call mollis aer and mollis aer we term it mulier which mulier i divine is this most constant wife who even now answering the letter of the oracle unknown to you unsought were clippd about with this most tender air the lofty cedar royal cymbeline personates thee and thy loppd branches point thy two sons forth who by belarius stoln for many years thought dead are now revived to the majestic cedar joind whose issue promises britain peace and plenty the fingers of the powers above do tune the harmony of this

for that you are well cooked indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache but a man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he would change places with his officer for look you sir you know not which way you shall go your death has eyes in s head then i have not seen him so pictured you must either be directed by some that take upon them to know or do take upon yourself that which i am sure you do not know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril and how you shall speed in your journeys end i think youll never return to tell one ill be hangd thenay or a

died whilst in the womb he stayd attending natures law whose father then as men report thou orphans father art thou shouldst have been and shielded him from this earthvexing smart great nature like his ancestry moulded the stuff so fair that he deserved the praise o the world as great sicilius heir why did you suffer iachimo slight thing of italy to taint his nobler heart and brain with needless jealosy and to become the geck and scorn o th others villany peep through thy marble mansion help or we poor ghosts will cry to the shining synod of the rest against thy deity he came in thunder his celestial breath was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle stoopd as to foot us his ascension is more sweet than our blest fields his royal bird prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak as when his god is pleased the marble pavement closes he is enterd his radiant root away and to be blest let us with care perform his great behest waking  sleep thou hast been a grandsire and begot a father to me and thou hast created a mother and two brothers but o scorn gone they went hence so soon as they were born and so i am awake poor wretches that depend on greatness favour dream as i have done wake and find nothing but alas i swerve many dream not to find neither deserve and yet are steepd in favours so am i that have this golden chance and know not why what fairies haunt this ground a book o rare

freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen tongue and brain not either both or nothing or senseless speaking or a speaking such as sense cannot untie be what it is the action of my life is like it which ill keep if but for sympathylucina lent not me her aid but took me in my throes that

his dignityfor this from stiller seats we came our parents and us twain that striking in our countrys cause fell bravely and were slain our fealty and tenantius right with honour to maintain like

the purse too light being drawn of heaviness of this contradiction you shall now be quit o the charity of a penny cord it sums up thousands in a trice you have no true debitor and creditor but it of
