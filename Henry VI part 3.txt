i wonder how the king escaped our hands and so do i victorious prince of york before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat possess it york for this is thine and not king henrys heirs and when the king comes offer no violence unless he seek to thrust you out perforce the bloody parliament shall this be calld unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice hath made us bywords to our enemies neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells ill plant plantagenet root him up who dares resolve thee richard claim the english crown exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry true clifford and thats richard duke of york be duke of lancaster let him be king and warwick shall disprove it you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers and with colours spread marchd through the city to the palace gates poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all plantagenet shall speak first hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live prove it henry and thou shalt be king suppose my lords he did it unconstraind think you twere prejudicial to his crown deposed he shall be in despite of all do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with armed men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood what good is this to england and himself turn this way henry and regard them not why should you sigh my lord long live king henry plantagenet embrace him and ill keep london with my soldiers how now fair lords what fare what news abroad ten days ago i drownd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befalln after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king musterd my soldiers gatherd flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought marchd toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henrys oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who lookd full gently on his warlike queen that robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of cliffords rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheerd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henrys head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easymelting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is englands royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaimd in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task how now what news why then it sorts brave warriors lets away what sayst thou henry wilt thou yield the crown then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine twas not your valour clifford drove me thence if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armour on forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes received and many blows repaid have robbd my strongknit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile how now my lord what hap what hope of good then let the earth be drunken with our blood ill kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like softhearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were playd in jest by counterfeiting actors here on my knee i vow to god above ill never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge away away once more sweet lords farewell no tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard markd him for the grave and wheresoeer he is hes surely dead from off the gates of york fetch down the head your fathers head which clifford placed there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered i think his understanding is bereft speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say clifford devise excuses for thy faults they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont ay but hes dead off with the traitors head and rear it in the place your fathers stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned englands royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scatterd foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany ill cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord tut thats a foolish observation richard be duke of gloucester now to london to see these honours in possession from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to englands king in lawful marriage to bona  and gracious madam in our kings behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereigns heart where fame late entering at his heedful ears hath placed thy beautys image and thy virtue injurious margaret because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdoms worth can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king and i the house of york thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour the more that henry was unfortunate such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground the leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edwards no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass the abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdond at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers ill undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his newmade bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me hes very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country and mine fair lady bona joins with yours tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long theres thy reward be gone this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and ill be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henrys misery but seek revenge on edwards mockery trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us   but see where somerset and clarence come speak suddenly my lords are we all friends then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edwards brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in nights coverture thy brother being carelessly encampd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well coverd with the nights black mantle at unawares may beat down edwards guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader   why then lets on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honour now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours richard and hastings let them go here is the duke ay but the case is alterd when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the peoples welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies then for his mind be edward englands king   but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyd unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows ill follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him now for a while farewell good duke of york ay thats the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortunes malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place and i choose clarence only for protector what answers clarence to his sovereigns will why then though loath yet must i be content well yoke together like a double shadow to henrys body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate ay therein clarence shall not want his part what news my friend unsavoury news but how made he escape my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide what counsel lords edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath passd in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him in warwickshire i have truehearted friends not mutinous in peace yet bold in war those will i muster up and thou son clarence shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent the knights and gentlemen to come with thee thou brother montague in buckingham northampton and in leicestershire shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou commandst and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends my sovereign with the loving citizens like to his island girt in with the ocean or modest dian circled with her nymphs shall rest in london till we come to him fair lords take leave and stand not to reply farewell my sovereign farewell sweet lords lets meet at coventry where is the post that came from valiant oxford how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow how far off is our brother montague where is the post that came from montague say somerville what says my loving son and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now then clarence is at hand i hear his drum who should that be belike unlookdfor friends o unbid spite is sportful edward come where slept our scouts or how are they seduced that we could hear no news of his repair nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and pluckd thee own call warwick patron and be penitent and thou shalt still remain the duke of york is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee o cheerful colours see where oxford comes o welcome oxford for we want thy help and lo where george of clarence sweeps along of force enough to bid his brother battle with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than the nature of a brothers love come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call o passing traitor perjured and unjust alas i am not coopd here for defence i will away towards barnet presently and bid thee battle edward if thou darest ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axes edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose topbranch overpeerd joves spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winters powerful wind these eyes that now are dimmd with deaths black veil have been as piercing as the midday sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were likend oft to kingly sepulchres for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smeard in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my bodys length why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust and live we how we can yet die we must why then i would not fly ah montague if thou be there sweet brother take my hand and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak come quickly montague or i am dead sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heavenwhile we pursued the horsemen of the north he slily stole away and left his men whereat the great lord of northumberland whose warlike ears could never brook retreat cheerd up the drooping army and himself lord clifford and lord stafford all abreast charged our main battles front and breaking in were by the swords of common soldiers slain richard hath best deserved of all my sons but is your grace dead my lord of somerset assist me then sweet warwick and i will for hither we have broken in by force thanks gentle norfolk stay by me my lords and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night the queen this day here holds her parliament but little thinks we shall be of her council by words or blows here let us win our right then leave me not my lords be resolute i mean to take possession of my right i am thine twas my inheritance as the earldom was it must and shall be so content thyself will you we show our title to the crown if not our swords shall plead it in the field sons peace twas by rebellion against his king what then he rose against him being his sovereign and made him to resign his crown perforce why whisper you my lords and answer not henry of lancaster resign thy crown what mutter you or what conspire you lords confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest this oath i willingly take and will perform now york and lancaster are reconciled farewell my gracious lord ill to my castle why how now sons and brother at a strife what is your quarrel how began it first about what mine boy not till king henry be dead i took an oath that he should quietly reign i shall be if i claim by open war thou canst not son it is impossible richard enough i will be king or die brother thou shalt to london presently and whet on warwick to this enterprise thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk and tell him privily of our intent you edward shall unto my lord cobham with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust for they are soldiers witty courteous liberal full of spirit while you are thus employd what resteth more but that i seek occasion how to rise and yet the king not privy to my drift nor any of the house of lancaster   but stay what news why comest thou in such post ay with my sword what thinkst thou that we fear them edward and richard you shall stay with me my brother montague shall post to london let noble warwick cobham and the rest whom we have left protectors of the king with powerful policy strengthen themselves and trust not simple henry nor his oaths what with five thousand men five men to twenty though the odds be great i doubt not uncle of our victory many a battle have i won in france when as the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success the army of the queen hath got the field my uncles both are slain in rescuing me and all my followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves my sons god knows what hath bechanced them but this i know they have demeand themselves like men born to renown by life or death three times did richard make a lane to me and thrice cried courage father fight it out and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encounterd him and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried charge and give no foot of ground and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre with this we charged again but out alas we bodged again as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with overmatching waves   ah hark the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury and were i strong i would not shun their fury the sands are numberd that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end   come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt and i abide your shot my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whateer you can afflict me with why come you not what multitudes and fear o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought oerrun my former time and if though canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this so triumph thieves upon their conquerd booty so true men yield with robbers so oermatchd shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth how illbeseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonderd at tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a womans face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutlands obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touchd would not have staind with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears this cloth thou dipdst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tellst the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand hardhearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads open thy gate of mercy gracious god my soul flies through these wounds to seek out theelord staffords father duke of buckingham is either slain or wounded dangerously i cleft his beaver with a downright blow that this is true father behold his blood sweet father do so set it on your head no i can better play the orator no quarrel but a slight contention now you are heir therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year i hear their drums lets set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from cliffords and northumberlands pursuit had he been taen we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whateer it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fairshining suns o speak no more for i have heard too much sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquishd him for hand to hand he would have vanquishd thee now my souls palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held three dearly as his souls redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou failstas god forbid the hour must edward fall which peril heaven forfend then strike up drums god and saint george for us now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts today that neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and neer was agamemnons brother wrongd by that false woman as this king by thee his father revelld in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matchd according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday even then that sunshine brewd a shower for him that washd his fathers fortunes forth of france and heapd sedition on his crown at home for what hath broachd this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slippd our claim until another age and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou deniest the gentle king to speak sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave and either victory or else a grave no wrangling woman well no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death for this world frowns and edwards sun is clouded bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine and ere my knee rise from the earths cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with they will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul now lords take leave until we meet again whereer it be in heaven or in earth now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail filld with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave see who it is and now the battles ended if friend or foe let him be gently used bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his illboding tongue no more shall speak clifford repent in bootless penitence thou pitiedst rutland i will pity thee even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best and why not queen tis even so yet you are warwick stilland brother heres the earl of wiltshires blood whom i encounterd as the battles joind good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms lets fight it out and not stand cavilling thus and i unto the sea from whence i came but i have reasons strong and forcible brother i go ill win them fear it not and thus most humbly i do take my leave     sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles you are come to sandal in a happy hour the army of the queen mean to besiege us yet to have joind with france in such alliance would more have strengthend this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage but the safer when tis backd with france so god help montague as he proves true to help king edward in his time of storm as every loyal subject ought to do then fare you well for i will hence again i came to serve a king and not a duke drummer strike up and let us march away what talk you of debating in few words if youll not here proclaim yourself our king ill leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succor you why shall we fight if you pretend no title ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself and now will i be edwards champion and whosoeer gainsays king edwards right by this i challenge him to single fight comfort my lord and so i take my leave montague montague for lancasterspeak thou for me and tell them what i did thus do i hope to shake king henrys head armd as we are lets stay within this house you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose father tear the crown from the usurpers head sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly brother though i be youngest give me leave about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours your right depends not on his life or death no god forbid your grace should be forsworn ill prove the contrary if youll hear me speak an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous therefore to arms and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy why do we finger thus i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henrys heart ay with five hundred father for a need a womans general what should we fear i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watchd him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassd round with dogs who having pinchd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmd like a younker prancing to his love three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but severd in a pale clearshining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vowd some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male   but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue say how he died for i will hear it all i cannot weep for all my bodys moisture scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name ill venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it nay if thou be that princely eagles bird show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each words deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but neer till now his scandal of retire i know it well lord warwick blame me not tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time whats to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our avemaries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak neer may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine are you there butcher o i cannot speak twas you that killd young rutland was it not for gods sake lords give signal to the fight northumberland i hold thee reverently break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my bigswoln heart upon that clifford that cruel childkiller ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset ill make thee curse the deed then executioner unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all i am resolved that cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mothers tongue iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be calld the sea shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broachd with the steely point of cliffords lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangour heard from far warwick revenge brother revenge my death so underneath the belly of their steeds that staind their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our springtime so now clifford i have singled thee alone suppose this arm is for the duke of york and this for rutland both bound to revenge wert thou environd with a brazen wall nay warwick single out some other chase for i myself will hunt this wolf to death a deadly groan like life and deaths departing revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford who not contented that he loppd the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york o would he did and so perhaps he doth tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace thou didst love york and i am son to york what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that hes dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy two hours life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucesters dukedom is too ominoussuch hope have all the line of john of gaunt well all assist you he that flies shall die and i to norfolk with my followersmy lords look where the sturdy rebel sits even in the chair of state belike he means backd by the power of warwick that false peer to aspire unto the crown and reign as king earl of northumberland he slew thy father and thine lord clifford and you both have vowd revenge on him his sons his favourites and his friends full well hath clifford playd the orator inferring arguments of mighty force but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things illgot had ever bad success and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousandfold more care to keep than in possession and jot of pleasure ah cousin york would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here sadhearted men much overgone with care here sits a king more woful than you are why am i dead do i not breathe a man ah simple men you know not what you swear look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and ill obey lets levy men and beat him back again so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece and next his throat unto the butchers knife what scene of death hath roscius now to actif i be not heavens be revenged on me well hast thou spoken cousin be it so yes warwick i remember it to my grief and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it plantagenet for all the claim thou layst think not that henry shall be so deposed thou art deceived tis not thy southern power of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud can set the duke up in despite of me nor i be thou a prey unto the house of york and die in bands for this unmanly deed yield to our mercy proud plantagenet hold clifford do not honour him so much to prick thy finger though to wound his heart what valour were it when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away it is wars prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour so doth the cony struggle in the net what would your grace have done unto him now beshrew me but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears had he been slaughterman to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul be it with resolution then to fight no nor your manhood that durst make you staythe hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel patience is for poltroons such as he he durst not sit there had your father lived my gracious lord here in the parliament let us assail the family of york whom should he follow but his natural king urge it no more lest that instead of words i send thee warwick such a messenger as shall revenge his death before i stir king henry be thy title right or wrong lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence may that ground gape and swallow me alive where i shall kneel to him that slew my father what wrong is this unto the prince your son how hast thou injured both thyself and us come cousin let us tell the queen these news in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome or live in peace abandond and despised chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life as for the brat of this accursed duke whose father slew my father he shall die soldiers away with him how now is he dead already or is it fear that makes him close his eyes ill open them in vain thou speakst poor boy my fathers blood hath stoppd the passage where thy words should enter had thy brethren here their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me no if i diggd up thy forefathers graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul and till i root out their accursed line and leave not one alive i live in hell therefore such pity as my rapiers point affords thy father hath no cause thy father slew my father therefore die plantagenet i come plantagenet and this thy sons blood cleaving to my blade shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood congeald with this do make me wipe off both ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm with downright payment showd unto my father now phaethon hath tumbled from his car and made an evening at the noontide prick so cowards fight when they can fly no further so doves do peck the falcons piercing talons so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives breathe out invectives gainst the officers i will not bandy with thee word for word but buckle with thee blows twice two for one ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin that is my office for my fathers sake heres for my oath heres for my fathers death my gracious liege this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside to whom do lions cast their gentle looks not to the beast that would usurp their den whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick not his that spoils her young before her face who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting not he that sets his foot upon her back the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood ambitious york doth level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father unreasonable creatures feed their young and though mans face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climbd unto their nest offer their own lives in their youngs defence for shame my liege make them your precedent were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his fathers fault and long hereafter say unto his child what my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away ah what a shame were this look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him why that is spoken like a toward prince i would your highness would depart the field the queen hath best success when you are absent and reason too who should succeed the father but the son ay crookback here i stand to answer thee or any he the proudest of thy sort ay and old york and yet not satisfied you said so much before and yet you fled i slew thy father callst thou him a child my liege the wound that bred this meeting here cannot be cured by words therefore be still now richard i am with thee here alone this is the hand that stabbd thy father york and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland and heres the heart that triumphs in their death and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother to execute the like upon thyself and so have at thee here burns my candle out ay here it dies which whiles it lasted gave king henry light o lancaster i fear thy overthrow more than my bodys parting with my soul my love and fear glued many friends to thee and now i fall thy tough commixture melts impairing henry strengthening misproud york the common people swarm like summer flies and whither fly the gnats but to the sun and who shines now but henrys enemies o phoebus hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds thy burning car never had scorchd the earth and henry hadst thou swayd as kings should do or as thy father and his father did giving no ground unto the house of york they never then had sprung like summer flies i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless and will not pity for at their hands i have deserved no pity the air hath got into my deadly wounds and much effuse of blood doth make me faint come york and richard warwick and the rest i stabbd your fathers bosoms split my breastwhat shall we suffer this lets pluck him down my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it he is both king and duke of lancaster and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain plantagenet of thee and these thy sons thy kinsman and thy friends ill have more lives than drops of blood were in my fathers veins base

mine ten times so much nay take me with thee good sweet exeter not that i fear to stay but love to go whither the queen intends forward away from scotland am i stoln even of pure love to greet mine own land with my wishful sight no harry harry tis no land of thine thy place is filld thy sceptre wrung from thee thy balm washd off wherewith thou wast anointed no bending knee will call thee caesar now no humble suitors press to speak for right no not a man comes for redress of thee for how can i help them and not myself let me embrace thee sour adversity for wise men say it is the wisest course my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french kings sister to wife for edward if this news be true poor queen and son your labour is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words by this account then margaret may win him for shes a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a battery in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears ay but shes come to beg warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is installd that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edwards place o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou wentst forlorn more than i seem and less than i was born to a man at least for less i should not be and men may talk of kings and why not i why so i am in mind and thats enough my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy but did you never swear and break an oath where did you dwell when i was king of england i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me then have you not broke your oaths so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is in gods name lead your kings name be obeyd and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turnd my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure ill well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty but warwick after god thou setst me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortunes spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessed land may not be punishd with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sins rebuke and my creators praise but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care come hither englands hope   if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our countrys bliss his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a sceptre and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me farewell my hector and my troys true hope wellminded clarence be thou fortunate sweet oxford and my loving montague and all at once once more a happy farewell thats not my fear my meed hath got me fame i have not stoppd mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allayd their swelling griefs my mercy dried their waterflowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppressd them with great subsidies nor forward of revenge though they much errd then why should they love edward more than me no exeter these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb the lamb will never cease to follow him ay my good lordmy lord i should say rather tis sin to flatter good was little better good gloucester and good devil were alike and both preposterous therefore not good lord the bird that hath been limed in a bush with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush and i the hapless male to one sweet bird have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was limed was caught and killd i daedalus my poor boy icarus thy father minos that denied our course the sun that seard the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life ah kill me with thy weapon not with words my breast can better brook thy daggers point than can my ears that tragic history but wherefore dost thou come ist for my life a persecutor i am sure thou art if murdering innocents be executing why then thou art an executioner hadst thou been killd when first thou didst presume thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine and thus i prophesy that many a thousand which now mistrust no parcel of my fear and many an old mans sigh and many a widows and many an orphans waterstanding eye men for their sons wives for their husbands and orphans for their parents timeless death shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born the owl shriekd at thy birthan evil sign the nightcrow cried aboding luckless time dogs howld and hideous tempest shook down trees the raven rookd her on the chimneys top and chattering pies in dismal discords sung thy mother felt more than a mothers pain and yet brought forth less than a mothers hope to wit an indigested and deformed lump not like the fruit of such a goodly tree teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born to signify thou camest to bite the world and if the rest be true which i have heard thou camest ay and for much more slaughter after this god forgive my sins and pardon theebut when the duke is slain theyll quickly fly for shame come down he made thee duke of york thy father was a traitor to the crown no for he could not so resign his crown but that the next heir should succeed and reign his is the right and therefore pardon me my conscience tells me he is lawful king they seek revenge and therefore will not yield accursed be he that seeks to make them foes here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger ill steal away and i i hope shall reconcile them all away for vengeance comes along with them nay stay not to expostulate make speed or else come after ill away before the doubt is that he will seduce the rest hark hark my lord what shouts are thesepeace thou and give king henry leave to speak exeter so will i poor queen how love to me and to her son hath made her break out into terms of rage revenged may she be on that hateful duke whose haughty spirit winged with desire will cost my crown and like an empty eagle tire on the flesh of me and of my son the loss of those three lords torments my heart ill write unto them and entreat them fair come cousin you shall be the messenger this battle fares like to the mornings war when dying clouds contend with growing light what time the shepherd blowing of his nails can neither call it perfect day nor night now sways it this way like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind now sways it that way like the selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind sometime the flood prevails and then the wind now one the better then another best both tugging to be victors breast to breast yet neither conqueror nor conquered so is the equal of this fell war here on this molehill will i sit me down to whom god will there be the victory for margaret my queen and clifford too have chid me from the battle swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence would i were dead if gods good will were so for what is in this world but grief and woe o god methinks it were a happy life to be no better than a homely swain to sit upon a hill as i do now to carve out dials quaintly point by point thereby to see the minutes how they run how many make the hour full complete how many hours bring about the day how many days will finish up the year how many years a mortal man may live when this is known then to divide the times so many hours must i tend my flock so many hours must i take my rest so many hours must i contemplate so many hours must i sport myself so many days my ewes have been with young so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean so many years ere i shall shear the fleece so minutes hours days months and years passd over to the end they were created would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep than doth a rich embroiderd canopy to kings that fear their subjects treachery o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth and to conclude the shepherds homely curds his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle his wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade all which secure and sweetly he enjoys is far beyond a princes delicates his viands sparkling in a golden cup his body couched in a curious bed when care mistrust and treason waits on him o piteous spectacle o bloody times whiles lions war and battle for their dens poor harmless lambs abide their enmity weep wretched man ill aid thee tear for tear and let our hearts and eyes like civil war be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief here at the palace i will rest awhile cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter minenay go not from me i will follow thee who can be patient in such extremes ah wretched man would i had died a maid and never seen thee never borne thee son seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus hadst thou but loved him half so well as i or felt that pain which i did for him once or nourishd him as i did with my blood thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there rather than have that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch thou hast undone thyself thy son and me and given unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance to entail him and his heirs unto the crown what is it but to make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy time warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas the duke is made protector of the realm and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves had i been there which am a silly woman the soldiers should have tossd me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act but thou preferrst thy life before thine honour and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself both from thy table henry and thy bed until that act of parliament be repeald whereby my son is disinherited the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours will follow mine if once they see them spread and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york thus do i leave thee come son lets away our army is ready come well after them thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone ay to be murderd by his enemies come son away we may not linger thus hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitors life wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be englands king wast you that revelld in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are your mess of sons to back you now the wanton edward and the lusty george and wheres that valiant crookback prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies or with the rest where is your darling rutland look york i staind this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapiers point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state i prithee grieve to make me merry york what hath thy fiery heart so parchd thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutlands death why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance thou wouldst be feed i see to make me sport york cannot speak unless he wear a crown a crown for york and lords bow low to him hold you his hands whilst i do set it on   ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henrys chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagenet is crownd so soon and broke his solemn oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henrys glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes what weepingripe my lord northumberland think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears off with his head and set it on york gates so york may overlook the town of york my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh and this soft courage makes your followers faint you promised knighthood to our forward son unsheathe your sword and dub him presently edward kneel down ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune go rate thy minions proud insulting boy becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king why how now longtongued warwick dare you speak when you and i met at saint albans last your legs did better service than your hands defy them then or else hold close thy lips but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul misshapen stigmatic markd by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings mount you my lord towards berwick post amain edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds having the fearful flying hare in sight with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath and bloody steel graspd in their ireful hands are at our backs and therefore hence amain no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albions queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares the more we stay the stronger grows our foe o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow our earl of warwick edwards greatest friend aside  if that go forward henrys hope is done king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edwards wellmeant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henrys son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henrys friend peace impudent and shameless warwick peace proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys i told your majesty as much before this proveth edwards love and warwicks honesty warwick these words have turnd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomest king henrys friend renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair let me give humble thanks for all at once tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on great lords wise men neer sit and wail their loss but cheerly seek how to redress their harms what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holdinganchor lost and half our sailors swallowd in the flood yet lives our pilot still ist meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have saved ah what a shame ah what a fault were this say warwick was our anchor what of that and montague our topmost what of him our slaughterd friends the tackles what of these why is not oxford here another anchor and somerset another goodly mast the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings and though unskilful why not ned and i for once allowd the skilful pilots charge we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck as good to chide the waves as speak them fair and what is edward but ruthless sea what clarence but a quicksand of deceit and richard but a ragged fatal rock all these the enemies to our poor bark say you can swim alas tis but a while tread on the sand why there you quickly sink bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish thats a threefold death this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that theres no hopedfor mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks why courage then what cannot be avoided twere childish weakness to lament or fear thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks this cheers my heart to see your forwardness lords knights and gentlemen what i should say my tears gainsay for every word i speak ye see i drink the water of mine eyes therefore no more but this henry your sovereign is prisoner to the foe his state usurpd his realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain his statutes cancelld and his treasure spent and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil you fight in justice then in gods name lords be valiant and give signal to the fight so part we sadly in this troublous world to meet with joy in sweet jerusalem ah that thy father had been so resolved ay thou wast born to be a plague to men o kill me too o ned sweet ned speak to thy mother boy canst thou not speak o traitors murderers they that stabbd caesar shed no blood at all did not offend nor were not worthy blame if this foul deed were by to equal it he was a man this in respect a child and men neer spend their fury on a child whats worse than murderer that i may name it no no my heart will burst and if i speak and i will speak that so my heart may burst butchers and villains bloody cannibals how sweet a plant have you untimely croppd you have no children butchers if you had the thought of them would have stirrd up remorse but if you ever chance to have a child look in his youth to have him so cut off as deathmen you have rid this sweet young prince nay never bear me hence dispatch me here here sheathe thy sword ill pardon thee my death what wilt thou not then clarence do it thou good clarence do sweet clarence do thou

that be right which warwick says is right there is no wrong but every thing is right fly father fly for all your friends are fled and warwick rages like a chafed bull away for death doth hold us in pursuit to edward but not to the english king nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope alls for the best yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should if a coward heard her speak these words infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him naked foil a man at arms i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes lest in our need he might infect another and make him of like spirit to himself if any such be hereas god forbid let him depart before we need his help and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else speak like a subject proud ambitious york suppose that i am now my fathers mouth resign thy chair and where i stand kneel thou whilst i propose the selfsame words to thee which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to let aesop fable in a winters night his currish riddles sort not with this place nay take away this scolding crookback rather i know my duty you are all undutiful lascivious edward and thou perjured george and thou misshapen dick i tell ye all i am your better traitors as ye are and thou usurpst my fathers right and minethe queen with all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in your castle she is hard by with twenty thousand men and therefore fortify your hold my lord ah one that was a woful lookeron when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enterd troy but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hew down and fell the hardesttimberd oak by many hands your father was subdued but only slaughterd by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crownd the gracious duke in high despite laughd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that eer i viewd the duke of norfolk sends you word by me the queen is coming with a puissant host and craves your company for speedy counsel royal commanders be in readiness for with a band of thirty thousand men comes warwick backing of the duke of york and in the towns as they do march along proclaims him king and many fly to him darraign your battle for they are at hand prepare you lords for edward is at hand ready to fight therefore be resoluteshe shall not need well meet her in the fieldah whither shall i fly to scape their hands ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes so looks the pentup lion oer the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws and so he walks insulting oer his prey and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword and not with such a cruel threatening look sweet clifford hear me speak before i die i am too mean a subject for thy wrath be thou revenged on men and let me live then let my fathers blood open it again he is a man and clifford cope with him o let me pray before i take my death to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me but twas ere i was born thou hast one son for his sake pity me lest in revenge thereof sith god is just he be as miserably slain as i ah let me live in prison all my days and when i give occasion of offence then let me die for now thou hast no cause di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuaeand i my lord will bear him company ah clifford murder not this innocent child lest thou be hated both of god and manand heres to right our gentlehearted king welcome my lord to this brave town of york yonders the head of that archenemy that sought to be encompassd with your crown doth not the object cheer

edwardbrother of gloucester at saint albans field this ladys husband sir richard grey was slain his lands then seized on by the conqueror her suit is now to repossess those lands which we in justice

then thy husbands lands i freely give thee but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean ay but i fear me in another sense what love thinkst thou i sue so much to get no by my troth i did not mean such love but now you partly may perceive my mind to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee why then thou shalt not have thy husbands lands therein thou wrongst thy children mightily ay if thou wilt say ay to my request no if thou dost say no to my demand aside  her looks do argue her replete with modesty her words do show her wit incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other she is for a king and she shall be my love or else my queen say that king edward take thee for his queen you cavil widow i did mean my queen no more than when my daughters call thee mother thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by gods mother i being but a bachelor have other some why tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons answer no more for thou shalt be my queen youll think

will yea brother richard are you offended too what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brothers will my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henrys queen for i have heard that she was there in place belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries now brother richard will you stand by us why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power the duke why warwick when we parted thou calldst me king yea brother of clarence are thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward

waned state for henrys regal crown well have we passd and now repassd the seas and brought desired help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom tush man abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone welcome sir john but why come you in arms thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest when we grow stronger then well make our claim till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning then be it as you will for tis my right and henry but usurps the diadem thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all if fortune serve me ill requite this kindness now for this night lets harbour here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon well forward towards warwick and his mates for well i wot that henry is no soldier ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee to flatter henry and forsake thy brother yet as we may well meet both thee and warwick come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day and that once gotten doubt not of large pay seize on the shamefaced henry bear him hence and once again proclaim us king of england you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow now stops thy spring my sea shal suck them dry and swell so much the higher

sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend this hand fast wound about thy coalblack hair shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off write in the dust this sentence with thy blood windchanging warwick now can change no more so other foes may set upon our backs stand we in good array for they no doubt will issue out again and bid us battle if not the city being but of small defence well quickly rouse the traitors in the same the harder matchd the greater victory my mind presageth happy gain and conquest now welcome more and ten times more beloved than if thou never hadst deserved our hate what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight or shall we beat the stones about thine ears yes warwick edward dares and leads the way lords to the field saint george and victory so lie thou there die thou and die our fear for warwick was a bug that feard us all now montague sit fast i seek for thee that warwicks bones may keep thine company we are advertised by our loving friends that they do hold their course toward tewksbury we having now the best at barnet field will thither straight for willingness rids way and as we march our strength will be augmented in every county as we go along strike up the drum cry courage and away brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood which by the heavens assistance and your strength must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night i need not add more fuel to your fire for well i wot ye blaze to burn them out give signal to the fight and to it lords now here a period of tumultuous broils away with oxford to hames castle straight for somerset off with his guilty head go bear them hence i will not hear them speak is proclamation made that who finds edward shall have a high reward and he his life bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak what can so young a thorn begin to prick edward what satisfaction canst thou make for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects and all the trouble thou hast turnd me to peace wilful boy or i will charm your tongue take that thou likeness of this railer here what doth she swoon use means for her recovery away with her go bear her hence perforce hes sudden if a thing comes in his head now march we hence discharge the common sort with pay and thanks and lets away to london and see our gentle queen how well she fares by this i hope she hath a son for me once more we sit in englands royal throne repurchased with the blood of enemies what valiant foemen like to autumns corn have we mowd down in tops of all their pride three dukes of somerset threefold renownd for hardy and undoubted champions two cliffords as the father and the son and two northumberlands two braver men neer spurrd their coursers at the trumpets sound with them the two brave bears warwick and montague that in their chains fetterd the kingly lion and made the forest tremble when they roard thus have we swept suspicion from our seat and made our footstool of security come hither bess and let me kiss my boy young ned for thee thine uncles and myself have in our armours watchd the winters night went all afoot in summers scalding heat that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain clarence and gloucester love my lovely queen and kiss your princely nephew brothers both now am i seated as my soul delights having my countrys peace and brothers loves away with her and waft her hence to france and now what rests but that we spend the time with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows such as befits the pleasure of the court sound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoy for here i hope begins our lasting joyyour highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonour to deny it her aside to clarence  yea is it so i see the lady hath a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit aside to clarence silence aside to clarence  ay widow then ill warrant you all your lands an if what pleases him shall pleasure you fight closer or good faith youll catch a blow aside to clarence god forbid that for hell take vantages aside to clarence  nay whip me then hell rather give her two aside to clarence  you shall have four if youll be ruled by him aside to clarence  ay good leave have you for you will have leave till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch aside to clarence  he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble aside to clarence  the match is made she seals it with a curtsy aside to clarence  the widow likes him not she knits her brows aside to clarence  the ghostly father now hath done his shrift the widow likes it not for she looks very sad that would be ten days wonder at the least by so much is the wonder in extremes ay edward will use women honourably would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my souls desire and me the lustful edwards title buried is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlookd for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a faroff shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying hell lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say ill cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford ill make my heaven in a ladys lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my  mothers womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to cheque to oerbear such as are of better person than myself ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live to account this world but hell until my misshaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and ilike one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall ill slay more gazers than the basilisk ill play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off ill pluck it down now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice and his wellchosen bride and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well not i no god forbid that i should wish them severd whom god hath joind together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood aside  i hear yet say not much but think the more aside  not i my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown ay in despite of all that shall withstand you now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the parkcorner well guessd believe me for that was my meaning but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk come then away lets ha no more ado the gates made fast brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within aside  but when the fox hath once got in his nose hell soon find means to make the body follow a wise stout captain and soon persuaded brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived why brother wherefore stand you on nice points and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns brother we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends away betimes before his forces join and take the greatgrown traitor unawares brave warriors march amain towards coventry see how the surly warwick mans the wall i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will ay by my faith for a poor earl to give ill do thee service for so good a gift alas that warwick had no more forecast but whiles he thought to steal the single ten the king was slily fingerd from the deck you left poor henry at the bishops palace and ten to one youll meet him in the tower come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down nay when strike now or else the iron cools the gates are open let us enter too thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason even with the dearest blood your bodies bear two of thy name both dukes of somerset have sold their lives unto the house of york and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold welcome good clarence this is brotherlike the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her if she have time to breathe be well assured her faction will be full as strong as ours it is and lo where youthful edward comes that you might still have worn the petticoat and neer have stoln the breech from lancaster by heaven brat ill plague ye for that word for gods sake take away this captive scold sprawlst thou take that to end thy agony marry and shall why should she live to fill the world with words clarence excuse me to the king my brother ill hence to london on a serious matter ere ye come there be sure to hear some news the tower the tower good day my lord what at your book so hard sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer suspicion always haunts the guilty mind the thief doth fear each bush an officer why what a peevish fool was that of crete that taught his son the office of a fowl an yet for all his wings the fool was drownd thinkst thou i am an executioner thy son i killd for his presumption ill hear no more die prophet in thy speech   for this amongst the rest was i ordaind what will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted see how my sword weeps for the poor kings death o may such purple tears be alway shed from those that wish the downfall of our house if any spark of life be yet remaining down down to hell and say i sent thee thither   i that have neither pity love nor fear indeed tis true that henry told me of for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward had i not reason think ye to make haste and seek their ruin that usurpd our right the midwife wonderd and the women cried o jesus bless us he is born with teeth and so i was which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog then since the heavens have shaped my body so let hell make crookd my mind to answer it i have no brother i am like no brother and this word love which graybeards call divine be resident in men like one another and not in me i am myself alone clarence beware thou keepst me from the light but i will sort a pitchy day for thee for i will buz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life and then to purge his fear ill be thy death king henry and the prince his son are gone clarence thy turn is next and then the rest counting myself but bad till i be best ill throw thy body in another room and triumph henry in thy day of doom aside  ill blast his harvest if your head were laid for yet i am not lookd on in the world this shoulder was ordaind so thick to heave and heave it shall some weight or break my back work thou the wayand thou shalt execute and that i love the tree from whence thou sprangst witness the loving kiss i give the fruit   and cried all hail when as he meant all harmaside to gloucester  he knows the game how true he keeps the wind aside to gloucester  i fear her not unless she chance to fall aside to gloucester  i think he means to beg a child of her aside to gloucester  as red as fire nay then her wax must melt aside to gloucester  he is the bluntest wooer in christendom aside to gloucester  when he was made a shriver twas for shift to whom my lord thats a day longer than a wonder lasts alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return i mind to tell him plainly what i think as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that theyll take no offence at our abuse then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford or else you would not have bestowd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wifes son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere in choosing for yourself you showd your judgment which being shallow you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwicks other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me fear not that my lord no warwick thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent that he consents if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself what else and that succession be determined it shall be done my sovereign with all speed a little fire is quickly trodden out which being sufferd rivers cannot quench in sign of truth i kiss your highness hand father of warwick know you what this means   look here i throw my infamy at thee i will not ruinate my fathers house who gave his blood to lime the stones together and set up lancaster why trowst thou warwick that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthahs when he sacrificed his daughter i am so sorry for my trespass made that to deserve well at my brothers hands i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe with resolution wheresoeer i meet thee as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad to plague thee for thy foul misleading me and so proudhearted warwick i defy thee and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks pardon me edward i will make amends and richard do not frown upon my faults for i will henceforth be no more unconstant a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came the very beams will dry those vapours up for every cloud engenders not a storm untutord lad thou art too malapert and theres for twitting me with perjury what what by heaven i will not do thee so much ease didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it to london all in post and as i guess to make a bloody supper in the tower the duty that i owe unto your majesty i seal upon the lips of this sweet babe what will your grace have done with margaret reignier her father to the king of france hath pawnd the sicils and jerusalem and hither have they sent it for her ransomright gracious lord i cannot brook delay may it please your highness to resolve me now and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me be pitiful dread lord and grant it then ay full as dearly as i love myself to do them good i would sustain some harm therefore i came unto your majesty so shall you bind me to your highness service what you command that rests in me to do no gracious lord except i cannot do it why then i will do what your grace commands thats soon performd because i am a subject i take my leave with many thousand thanks the fruits of love i mean my loving liege my love till death my humble thanks my prayers that love which virtue begs and virtue grants why then you mean not as i thought you did my mind will never grant what i perceive your highness aims at if i aim aright to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison why then mine honesty shall be my dower for by that loss i will not purchase them herein your highness wrongs both them and me but mighty lord this merry inclination accords not with the sadness of my suit please you dismiss me either with ay or no then no my lord my suit is at an end tis better said than done my gracious lord i am a subject fit to jest withal but far unfit to be a sovereign and that is more than i will yield unto i know i am too mean to be your queen and yet too good to be your concubine twill grieve your grace my sons should call you fatherhow many children hast thou widow tell me twere pity they should lose their fathers lands sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love brothers you muse what chat we two have had why clarence to myself now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarnd they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you   but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys   for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me nay stay sir john awhi le and well debate by what safe means the crown may be recoverd away i say i charge ye bear her hence wheres richard gonethree my most gracious lord why stops my lord shall i not hear my taskmy gracious lord henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gatefair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit whats he approacheth boldly to our presencewhy say fair queen whence springs this deep despair whateer it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side   yield not thy neck to fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eased if france can yield relief renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off the more i stay the more ill succor thee welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen but is he gracious in the peoples eye then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona now sister let us hear your firm resolve then warwick thus our sister shall be edwards and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoised draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edwards good success then tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this the alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner and mine with hers and thine and margarets therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid then englands messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shalt waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by wars mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of francethen warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellowd years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers ay for if edward repossess the crown tis like that richmond with the rest shall down and thus i seal my truth and bid adieu oxford oxford for lancaster away away to meet the queens great power women and children of so high a courage and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame o brave young prince thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee long mayst thou live to bear his image and renew his glories i thought no less it is his policy to haste thus fast to find us unprovided here pitch our battle hence we will not budge for my part ill not trouble thee with wordsyour grant or your denial shall be mine   yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your kings desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire dear brother how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen my quarrel and this english queens are one tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willow garland for his sakewarwick this is some post to us or theeto warwick  my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquess montague   these from our king unto your majesty   and madam these for you from whom i know not my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride these were her words utterd with mad disdain tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willow garland for his sake tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on he more incensed against your majesty than all the rest discharged me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwicks daughter that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundy he was conveyd by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishops huntsmen rescued him for hunting was his daily exercisemy lords forbear this talk here comes the king what are they that fly there my liege it is young henry earl of richmond my lord i like not of this flight of edwards for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars before t be long as henrys late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and ours therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst forthwith well send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity it shall be so he shall to brittany come therefore lets about it speedily at southam i did leave him with his forces and do expect him here some two hours hence it is not his my lord here southam lies the drum your honour hears marcheth from warwick they are at hand and you shall quickly know somerset somerset for lancaster ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are we might recover all our loss again the queen from france hath brought a puissant power even now we heard the news ah couldst thou fly ah warwick montague hath breathed his last and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick and said commend me to my valiant brother and more he would have said and more he spoke which sounded like a clamour in a vault that mought not be distinguished but at last i well might hear delivered with a groan o farewell warwick and he that will not fight for such a hope go home to bed and like the owl by day if he arise be mockd and wonderd at but hes deceived we are in readiness nor i but stoop with patience to my fortunesetting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and englands queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think now messenger what letters or what news from france thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory but in the midst of this brightshining day i spy a black suspicious threatening cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us hold richard hold for we have done too muchwhy knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself tis better using france than trusting france let us be backd with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies and hastings as he favours edwards cause to lynn my lord and ship from thence to flanders my liege ill knock once more to summon them why master mayor why stand you in a doubt open the gates we are king henrys friends the good old man would fain that all were well so twere not long of him but being enterd i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule sound trumpet edward shall be here proclaimd come fellowsoldier make thou proclamationmy lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befalln king edward no but the loss of his own royal person ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner either betrayd by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares and as i further have to understand is new committed to the bishop of york fell warwicks brother and by that our foe till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edwards offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortunes cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edwards fruit true heir to the english crown i am informd that he comes towards london to set the crown once more on henrys head guess thou the rest king edwards friends must down but to prevent the tyrants violence for trust not him that hath once broken faith ill hence forthwith unto the sanctuary to save at least the heir of edwards right there shall i rest secure from force and fraud come therefore let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die thanks noble clarence worthy brother thankscome on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppressd tis the lord hastings the kings chiefest friend who goes therewhat will he not to bed tomorrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report tis the more honour because more dangerous ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from nightfoesbut say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent unless our halberds did shut up his passage stay or thou diesto is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken himmadam what makes you in this sudden change what loss of some pitchd battle against warwick then is my sovereign slain these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may warwick may lose that now hath won the day but madam where is warwick then becomethis way my lord for this way lies the game better do so than tarry and be hangdsubjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majestymy lords we were forewarned of your coming and shut the gates for safety of ourselves for now we owe allegiance unto henry true my good lord i know you for no less ay say you so the gates shall then be opendedward the fourth by the grace of god king of england and
