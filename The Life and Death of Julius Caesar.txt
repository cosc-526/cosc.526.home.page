them to tiber banks and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all   see whether their basest metal be not moved they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness go you down that way towards the capitol it is no matter let no images be hung with caesars trophies ill about and drive away the vulgar from the streets so do you too where you perceive them thick these growing feathers pluckd from caesars wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulnesswhy sir a carpenterwhere is thy leather apron and thy rule what dost thou with thy best apparel on you sir what trade are you but what trade art thou answer me directly what trade thou knave thou naughty knave what trade what meanest thou by that mend me thou saucy fellow wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home what tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariotwheels you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome knew you not pompey many a time and oft have you climbd up to walls and battlements to towers and windows yea to chimneytops your infants in your arms and there have sat the livelong day with patient expectation to see great pompey pass the streets of rome and when you saw his chariot but appear have you not made an universal shout that tiber trembled underneath her banks to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores and do you now put on your best attire and do you now cull out a holiday and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompeys blood be gone run to your houses fall upon your knees pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude may

mender of bad soles nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir i can mend you why sir cobble you truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesmans matters

to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumphdisrobe the images if you do find them deckd with ceremoniescalpurnia calpurnia stand you directly in antonius way when he doth run his course antonius forget not in your speed antonius to touch calpurnia for our elders say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse set on and leave no ceremony out ha who calls who is it in the press that calls on me i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar speak caesar is turnd to hear what man is that set him before me let me see his face what sayst thou to me now speak once again he is a dreamer let us leave him pass antonius let me have men about me that are fat sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous would he were fatter but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing such men as he be never at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous i rather tell thee what is to be feard than what i fear for always i am caesar come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out help ho they murder caesar whos within go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success caesar shall forth the things that threatend me neer lookd but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanished what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come   what say the augurers the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear no caesar shall not danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he we are two lions litterd in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humour i will stay at home   heres decius brutus he shall tell them so and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today cannot is false and that i dare not falser i will not come today tell them so decius shall caesar send a lie have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth decius go tell them caesar will not come the cause is in my will i will not come that is enough to satisfy the senate but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know calpurnia here my wife stays me at home she dreamt tonight she saw my statua which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath beggd that i will stay at home today and this way have you well expounded it how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia i am ashamed i did yield to them give me my robe for i will go   and look where publius is come to fetch me welcome publius what brutus are you stirrd so early too good morrow casca caius ligarius caesar was neer so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean what is t oclock i thank you for your pains and courtesy   see antony that revels long o nights is notwithstanding up good morrow antony bid them prepare within i am to blame to be thus waited for now cinna now metellus what trebonius i have an hours talk in store for you remember that you call on me today be near me that i may remember you good friends go in and taste some wine with me and we like friends will straightway go together to the soothsayer  the ides of march are come what touches us ourself shall be last served what is the fellow mad are we all ready what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress i must prevent thee cimber these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawd from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning thy brother by decree is banished if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied what brutus hence wilt thou lift up olympus doth not brutus bootless kneel et tu brute then fall caesarpeace ho caesar speaks bid every noise be still peace yet again you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me why you were with him were you not why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell ashouting why for that too why for that too ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every puttingby mine honest neighbours shouted why antony i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him a crownyet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronetsand as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut an i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts but theres no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less ay ay he spoke greek nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesars images are put to silence fare you well there was more foolery yet if i could remember it no i am promised forth ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating do so farewell both are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction a common slaveyou know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches joind and yet his hand not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd besidesi ha not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace hooting and shrieking when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow farewell cicero a roman your ear is good cassius what night is this who ever knew the heavens menace so but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering telltale hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest stand close awhile for here comes one in haste o he sits high in all the peoples hearts and that which would appear offence in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness no you shall confess that you are both deceived here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here let us not leave him out indeed he is not fit speak hands for me go to the pulpit brutushere my lord what mean you caesar think you to walk forth you shall not stir out of your house today caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch a lioness hath whelped in the streets and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets o caesar these things are beyond all use and i do fear them when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes alas my lord your wisdom is consumed in confidence do not go forth today call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own well send mark antony to the senatehouse and he shall say you are not well today let me upon my knee prevail in this say he is sickcaesar my lord i shall remember when caesar says do this it is performd caesar fear him not caesar hes not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given so to most noble caesar o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure fare thee well i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesars death hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world i do beseech ye if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfil your pleasure live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no mean of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age i doubt not of your wisdom let each man render me his bloody hand first marcus brutus will i shake with you next caius cassius do i take your hand now decius brutus yours now yours metellus yours cinna and my valiant casca yours though last not last in love yours good trebonius gentlemen allalas what shall i say my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer that i did love thee caesar o tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy thy anthony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes most noble in the presence of thy corse had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies pardon me julius here wast thou bayd brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayd from the point by looking down on caesar friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous thats all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral be it so i do desire no more o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarterd with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesars spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarchs voice cry  havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial   you serve octavius caesar do you not caesar did write for him to come to rome thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water is thy master coming post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things lend me your hand for brutus sake i am beholding to you you gentle romans friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answerd it here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men come i to speak in caesars funeral he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse was this ambition yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honourable men but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men bearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it will you be patient will you stay awhile i have oershot myself to tell you of it i fear i wrong the honourable men whose daggers have stabbd caesar i do fear it you will compel me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will shall i descend and will you give me leave nay press not so upon me stand far off if you have tears prepare to shed them now you all do know this mantle i remember the first time ever caesar put it on twas on a summers evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii look in this place ran cassius dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd and as he pluckd his cursed steel away mark how the blood of caesar followd it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knockd or no for brutus as you know was caesars angel judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompeys statua which all the while ran blood great caesar fell o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourishd over us o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity these are gracious drops kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesars vesture wounded look you here here is himself marrd as you see with traitors stay countrymen good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny they that have done this deed are honourable what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honourable and will no doubt with reasons answer you i come not friends to steal away your hearts i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir mens blood i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesars wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak why friends you go to do you know not what wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves alas you know not i must tell you then you have forgot the will i told you of here is the will and under caesars seal to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventyfive drachmas hear me with patience moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbours and newplanted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs for ever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves here was a caesar when comes such another now let it work mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt   how now fellow where is he and thither will i straight to visit him he comes upon a wish fortune is merry and in this mood will give us any thing belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them bring me to octavius these many then shall die their names are prickd he shall not live look with a spot i damn him but lepidus go you to caesars house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honours on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governd by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and traind and bid go forth a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds on abjects orts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property and now octavius listen great thingsbrutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretchd and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answered tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but tis not so octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field why do you cross me in this exigent no caesar we will answer on their charge make forth the generals would have some words in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesars heart crying long live hail caesar not stingless too villains you did not so when your vile daggers hackd one another in the sides of caesar you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck o you flatterers old cassius still where is he this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth keep this man safe give him all kindness i had rather have such men my friends than enemies go on and see whether brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius tent how every thing is chanced this was the noblest roman of them all all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them his life was gentle and the elements so mixd in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a mancaesar beware the ides of march beware the ides of march at mine own house good lady about the ninth hour lady madam not yet i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the capitol that i have lady if it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear me i shall beseech him to befriend himself none that i know will be much that i fear may chance good morrow to you here the street is narrow the throng that follows caesar at the heels of senators of praetors common suitors will crowd a feeble man almost to death ill get me to a place more void and there speak to great caesar as he comes along ay caesar but not gonea soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march not i i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony let me not hinder cassius your desires ill leave you cassius be not deceived if i have veild my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me what means this shouting i do fear the people choose caesar for their king i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long what is it that you would impart to me if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heapd on caesar that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us the games are done and caesar is returning i will do so but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossd in conference by some senators ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad i should not then ask casca what had chanced what was the second noise for was the crown offered him thrice tell us the manner of it gentle casca tis very like he hath the failing sickness what said he when he came unto himself and after that he came thus sad away what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school and so it is for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you what lucius ho i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day lucius i say i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly when lucius when awake i say what lucius get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general he would be crownd how that might change his nature theres the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking crown himthat and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayd more than his reason but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climberupward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell get you to bed again it is not day is not tomorrow boy the ides of march look in the calendar and bring me word the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them   brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself shall rome   c speak strike redress brutus thou sleepst awake such instigations have been often droppd where i have took them up shall rome   c thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one mans awe what rome my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was calld a king speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus tis good go to the gate somebody knocks   since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection is he alone do you know them let em enter   they are the faction o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention i have been up this hour awake all night know i these men that come along with you he is welcome hither he is welcome too they are all welcome what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night give me your hands all over one by one no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the times abuse if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let highsighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passd from him o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow any thing that other men begin shall no man else be touchd but only caesar our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesars spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide em this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be calld purgers not murderers and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesars arm when caesars head is off alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company peace count the clock by the eighth hour is that the uttermost now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and ill fashion him good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our

senatehouse caesar tis strucken eight aside  that every like is not the same o caesar the heart of brutus yearns to think upon what said popilius lena look how he makes to caesar mark him cassius be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change he is addressd press near and second him i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand stiff ambitions debt is paid wheres publius talk not of standing publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else so tell them publius do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers fates we will know your pleasures that we shall die we know tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesars friends that have abridged his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesars blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons oer our heads lets all cry peace freedom and liberty how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompeys basis lies along no worthier than the dust what shall we forth soft who comes here a friend of antonys thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honour depart untouchd i know that we shall have him well to friend but here comes antony   welcome mark antony o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded or else were this a savage spectacle our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied you shall mark antony by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesars death what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies it shall advantage more than do us wrong mark antony here take you caesars body you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you dot by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended prepare the body then and follow us then follow me and give me audience friends cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers those that will hear me speak let em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be rendered of caesars death be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesars to him i say that brutus love to caesar was no less than his if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all free men as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i offended who is here so vile that will not love his country if any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply then none have i offended i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforced for which he suffered death   here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with this i departthat as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death my countrymen good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony do grace to caesars corpse and grace his speech tending to caesars glories which mark antony by our permission is allowd to make i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke stand ho what now lucilius is cassius near he greets me well your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied he is not doubted a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved thou hast described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforced ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial comes his army on hark he is arrived   march gently on to meet him stand ho speak the word along judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies and if not so how should i wrong a brother cassius be content speak your griefs softly i do know you well before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience lucilius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference let lucius and titinius guard our door you wronged yourself to write in such a case let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemnd to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers the name of cassius honours this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice sake what villain touchd his body that did stab and not for justice what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman go to you are not cassius i say you are not away slight man hear me for i will speak must i give way and room to your rash choler shall i be frighted when a madman stares all this ay more fret till your proud heart break go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble must i budge must i observe you must i stand and crouch under your testy humour by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men if you did i care not peace peace you durst not so have tempted him no for your life you durst not you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius should i have answerd caius cassius so when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces you did i do not till you practise them on me i do not like your faults a flatterers would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus sheathe your dagger be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonour shall be humour o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again when i spoke that i was illtemperd too and my heart too whats the matter yes cassius and from henceforth when you are overearnest with your brutus hell think your mother chides and leave you so get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence ill know his humour when he knows his time what should the wars do with these jigging fools companion hence lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight lucius a bowl of wine o cassius i am sick of many griefs no man bears sorrow better portia is dead she is dead impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strongfor with her death that tidings camewith this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallowd fire even so speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine in this i bury all unkindness cassius come in titinius     welcome good messala now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities no more i pray you messala i have here received letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi with what addition therein our letters do not well agree mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one no messala nothing messala why ask you hear you aught of her in yours now as you are a roman tell me true why farewell portia we must die messala with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now well to our work alive what do you think of marching to philippi presently your reason good reasons must of force give place to better the people twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refreshd newadded and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back under your pardon you must note beside that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest there is no more to say lucius   my gown   farewell good messala good night titinius noble noble cassius good night and good repose every thing is well good night good brother farewell every one     give me the gown where is thy instrument what thou speakst drowsily poor knave i blame thee not thou art oerwatchd call claudius and some other of my men ill have them sleep on cushions in my tent i pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius i will not have it so lie down good sirs it may be i shall otherwise bethink me look lucius heres the book i sought for so i put it in the pocket of my gown bear with me good boy i am much forgetful canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile and touch thy instrument a strain or two it does my boy i trouble thee too much but thou art willing i should not urge thy duty past thy might i know young bloods look for a time of rest it was well done and thou shalt sleep again i will not hold thee long if i do live i will be good to thee   this is a sleepy tune o murderous slumber layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music gentle knave good night i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee if thou dost nod thou breakst thy instrument ill take it from thee and good boy good night let me see let me see is not the leaf turnd down where i left reading here it is i think   how ill this taper burns ha who comes here i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition it comes upon me art thou any thing art thou some god some angel or some devil that makest my blood cold and my hair to stare speak to me what thou art why comest thou well then i shall see thee again why i will see thee at philippi then   now i have taken heart thou vanishest ill spirit i would hold more talk with thee boy lucius varro claudius sirs awake claudius he thinks he still is at his instrument lucius awake didst thou dream lucius that thou so criedst out yes that thou didst didst thou see any thing sleep again lucius sirrah claudius   fellow thou awake why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep ay saw you any thing go and commend me to my brother cassius bid him set on his powers betimes before and we will follow they stand and would have parley words before blows is it so countrymen good words are better than bad strokes octavius o yes and soundless too for you have stoln their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands unless thou bringst them with thee o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honourable ho lucilius hark a word with you even so lucilius even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not therefore our everlasting farewell take for ever and for ever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made why then lead on o that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known come ho away ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side   let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow ride ride messala let them all come down where where messala doth his body lie titinius face is upward o julius caesar thou art mighty yet thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails are yet two romans living such as these the last of all the romans fare thee well it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow friends i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay i shall find time cassius i shall find time come therefore and to thasos send his body his funerals shall not be in our camp lest it discomfort us lucilius come and come young cato let us to the field labeo and flavius set our battles on tis three oclock and romans yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight yet countrymen o yet hold up your heads and i am brutus marcus brutus i brutus my countrys friend know me for brutus come poor remains of friends rest on this rock sit thee down clitus slaying is the word it is a deed in fashion hark thee clitus peace then no words hark thee dardanius come hither good volumnius list a word why this volumnius the ghost of caesar hath appeard to me two several times by night at sardis once and this last night here in philippi fields i know my hour is come nay i am sure it is volumnius thou seest the world volumnius how it goes our enemies have beat us to the pit   it is more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us good volumnius thou knowst that we two went to school together even for that our love of old i prithee hold thou my swordhilts whilst i run on it farewell to you and you and you volumnius strato thou hast been all this while asleep farewell to thee too strato countrymen my heart doth joy that yet in all my life i found no man but he was true to me i shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto so fare you well at once for brutus tongue hath almost ended his lifes history night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest that have but labourd to attain this hour hence i will follow   i prithee strato stay thou by thy lord thou art a fellow of a good respect thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it hold then my sword and turn away thy face while i do run upon it wilt thou strato farewell good strato   caesar now be still i killd not thee with half so good a willfellow come from the throng look upon caesar will you go see the order of the course i pray you do brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations tell me good brutus can you see your face tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this ages yoke have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laugher or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous ay do you fear it then must i think you would not have it so i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour well honour is the subject of my story i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winters cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did the torrent roard and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great age thou art shamed rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man when could they say till now that talkd of rome that her wide walls encompassd but one man now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brookd the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today casca will tell us what the matter is they shouted thrice what was the last cry for who offered him the crown but soft i pray you what did caesar swound no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness did cicero say any thing to what effect will you sup with me tonight casca will you dine with me tomorrow good i will expect you so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite i will do so till then think of the world   well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humour me i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure whos there casca by your voice a very pleasing night to honest men those that have known the earth so full of faults for my part i have walkd about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunderstone and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fool and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous qualitywhy you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers minds are dead and we are governd with our mothers spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure and why should caesar be a tyrant then poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar but o grief where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am armd and dangers are to me indifferent theres a bargain made now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblestminded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourabledangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompeys porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favours like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend   cinna where haste you so no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts am i not stayd for cinna am i not stayd for tell me be you content good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetors chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus statue all this done repair to pompeys porch where you shall find us is decius brutus and trebonius there that done repair to pompeys theatre   come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you yes every man of them and no man here but honours you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you this is trebonius this decius brutus this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber shall i entreat a word and let us swear our resolution but what of cicero shall we sound him i think he will stand very strong with us then leave him out decius well urged i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together yet i fear him for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar the clock hath stricken three but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustomd terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today nay we will all of us be there to fetch him the morning comes upon s well leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans what urge you your petitions in the street come to the capitol what enterprise popilius he wishd today our enterprise might thrive i fear our purpose is discovered casca be sudden for we fear prevention brutus what shall be done if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself trebonius knows his time for look you brutus he draws mark antony out of the way pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber i could be well moved if i were as you if i could pray to move prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star of whose truefixd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament the skies are painted with unnumberd sparks they are all fire and every one doth shine but theres but one in all doth hold his place so in the world tis furnishd well with men and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank unshaked of motion and that i am he let me a little show it even in this that i was constant cimber should be banishd and constant do remain to keep him so some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief where is antony why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be calld the men that gave their country liberty ay every man away brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose your voice shall be as strong as any mans in the disposing of new dignities mark antony i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us will you be prickd in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you brutus a word with you   you know not what you do do not consent that antony speak in his funeral know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter i know not what may fall i like it not stand ho most noble brother you have done me wrong brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground that you have wrongd me doth appear in this you have condemnd and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man were slighted off in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offence should bear his comment i an itching palm you know that you are brutus that speak this or by the gods this speech were else your last chastisement brutus bay not me ill not endure it you forget yourself to hedge me in i am a soldier i older in practise abler than yourself to make conditions i am urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no further ist possible o ye gods ye gods must i endure all this is it come to this you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me i durst not what durst not tempt him do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for i denied you not i did not he was but a fool that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart a friend should bear his friends infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are you love me not a friendly eye could never see such faults come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world hated by one he loves braved by his brother chequed like a bondman all his faults observed set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote to cast into my teeth o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutus mine richer than gold if that thou best a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him do you confess so much give me your hand o brutus have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humour which my mother gave me makes me forgetful how now whats the matter ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme bear with him brutus tis his fashion away away be gone and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us i did not think you could have been so angry of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils ha portia how scaped i killing when i crossd you so o insupportable and touching loss upon what sickness and died so o ye immortal gods my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge fill lucius till the wine oerswell the cup i cannot drink too much of brutus love portia art thou gone cicero one i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so i do not think it good this it is tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offence whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness hear me good brother then with your will go on well along ourselves and meet them at philippi no more good night early tomorrow will we rise and hence o my dear brother this was an ill beginning of the night never come such division tween our souls let it not brutus good night my lord stand fast titinius we must out and talk antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless flatterers now brutus thank yourself this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have ruled a peevish schoolboy worthless of such honour joind with a masker and a reveller why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark the storm is up and all is on the hazard messala messala this is my birthday as this very day was cassius born give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compelld to set upon one battle all our liberties you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands who to philippi here consorted us this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly oer our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rest still incertain lets reason with the worst that may befall if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome for ever and for ever farewell brutus if we do meet again well smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made o look

on your condition i should not know you brutus dear my lord make me acquainted with your cause of grief brutus is wise and were he not in health he would embrace the means to come by it is brutus sick

rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness no my brutus you have some sick offence within your mind which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of and upon my knees i charm you by
