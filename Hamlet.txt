whos there long live the king he tis now struck twelve get thee to bed francisco have you had quiet guard well good night if you do meet horatio and marcellus the rivals of my watch bid them make haste say what is horatio there welcome horatio welcome good marcellus i have seen nothing sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen last night of all when yond same star thats westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one in the same figure like the king thats dead looks it not like the king  mark it horatio it would be spoke to see it stalks away how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you ont i think it be no other but een so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars tis here it was about to speak when the cock crew we do my lord armd my lord my lord from head to foot longer longernay answer me stand and unfold yourself bernardo you come most carefully upon your hour for this relief much thanks tis bitter cold and i am sick at heart not a mouse stirring i think i hear them stand ho whos there give you good night bernardo has my place give you good nightfriends to this ground a piece of him tush tush twill not appear well sit we down and let us hear bernardo speak of this most like it harrows me with fear and wonder what art thou that usurpst this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak stay speak speak i charge thee speak before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frownd he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appeard to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article designd his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach int which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and romage in the land a mote it is to trouble the minds eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptunes empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen but soft behold lo where it comes again   ill cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me   if thou art privy to thy countrys fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus do if it will not stand tis here and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty hail to your lordship the same my lord and your poor servant ever a truant disposition good my lord my lord i came to see your fathers funeral indeed my lord it followd hard upon where my lord i saw him once he was a goodly king my lord i think i saw him yesternight my lord the king your father season your admiration for awhile with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and bernardo on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounterd a figure like your father armed at point exactly capape appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes within his truncheons length whilst they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliverd both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanishd from our sight as i do live my honourd lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it o yes my lord he wore his beaver up a countenance more in sorrow than in anger nay very pale most constantly it would have much amazed you while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred not when i sawt it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silverd i warrant it will it is a nipping and an eager air i think it lacks of twelve indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk   what does this mean my lord is it a custom look my lord it comes it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone no by no means do not my lord what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles oer his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath be ruled you shall not go he waxes desperate with imagination have after to what issue will this come heaven

i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted if not from lord hamlet let him bless thee too reads  horatio when thou shalt have overlooked this give these fellows some means to the king they have letters for him ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valour and in the grapple i boarded them on the instant they got clear of our ship so i alone became their prisoner they have dealt with me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they did i am to do a good turn for them let the king have the letters i have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore

certain ist possible i beseech you ay good my lord how was this seald so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot why what a king is this it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there peace who comes here no my good lord ist not possible to understand in another tongue you will dot sir really his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head you will lose this wager my lord nay good my lord if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit they bleed on both sides how is it my lord never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane heres yet some liquor left now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither what is it ye would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook falln on the inventors reads all this can i truly deliver of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performd even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happenand liegemen to the dane o farewell honest soldier who hath relieved you holla bernardo what has this thing appeard again tonight horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it peace break thee off look where it comes again thou art a scholar speak to it horatio question it horatio it is offended tis gone and will not answer is it not like the king thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night jointlabourer with the day who ist that can inform me shall i strike at it with my partisan tis gone   we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time lets dot i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently my good lord my lord upon the platform where we watchd look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it you shall not go my lord lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him something is rotten in the state of denmark nay lets follow him withinlord hamlet how ist my noble lord nor i my lord ay by heaven my lord my lord we will not nor i my lord in faith we have sworn my lord alreadythough yet of hamlet our dear brothers death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen the imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barrd your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brothers death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with the dream of his advantage he hath not faild to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephews purposeto suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltimand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these delated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy what do you call the play give me some light away what gertrude how does hamlet alas alas go seek him there hamlet this deed for thine especial safety which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast donemust send thee hence with fiery quickness therefore prepare thyself the bark is ready and the wind at help the associates tend and every thing is bent for england what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giantlike let him go gertrude do not fear our person theres such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will tell me laertes why thou art thus incensed let him go gertrude speak man dead let him demand his fill good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear fathers death ist writ in your revenge that swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser will you know them then now must your conscience my acquaintance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life tis hamlets character naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me to thine own peace if he be now returnd as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practise and call it accident a norman the very same not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a plurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed more than in words lets further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assayd therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this should blast in proof soft let me see well make a solemn wager on your cunnings i hat when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink ill have prepared him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venomd stuck our purpose may hold there   how now sweet queen pluck them asunder come hamlet come and take this hand from me give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is betterd we have therefore odds set me the stoops of wine upon that table if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlets better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmarks crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth now the king dunks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine heres to thy health   give him the cup gertrude do not drink part them they are incensed she swounds to see them bleed o yet defend me friends i am but hurtin that and all things will we show our duty most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephews levies which to him appeard to be a preparation gainst the polack but better lookd into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grieved that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give the assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown   that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set downwe doubt it nothing heartily farewell   and now laertes whats the news with you you told us of some suit what ist laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and loose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes have you your fathers leave what says polonius take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son how is it that the clouds still hang on you tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the kings rouse the heavens all bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlets transformation so call it sith nor the exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his fathers death that thus hath put him so much from the understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbourd to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that opend lies within our remedy thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thou still hast been the father of good news o speak of that that do i long to hear thyself do grace to them and bring them in   he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your sons distemper well we shall sift him   welcome my good friends say voltimand what from our brother norway it likes us well and at our more considerd time well read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your welltook labour go to your rest at night well feast together most welcome home but how hath she received his love as of a man faithful and honourable do you think tis this not that i know how may we try it further we will try it with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if t be the affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for aside          o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burthen love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lackd form a little was not like madness theres something in his soul oer which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this somethingsettled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you ont it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatchd go how fares our cousin hamlet i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine have you heard the argument is there no offence in t i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put upon this fear which now goes too freefooted thanks dear my lord   o my offence is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upont a brothers murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brothers blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence and whats in prayer but this twofold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardond being down then ill look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessd of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardond and retain the offence in the corrupted currents of this world offences gilded hand may shove by justice and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelld even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one can not repent o wretched state o bosom black as death o limed soul that struggling to be free art more engaged help angels make assay bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the newborn babe all may be well rising  my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts never to heaven go theres matter in these sighs these profound heaves you must translate tis fit we understand them where is your son o heavy deed it had been so with us had we been there his liberty is full of threats to all to you yourself to us to every one alas how shall this bloody deed be answerd it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restraind and out of haunt this mad young man but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from divulging let it feed even on the pith of life where is he gone o gertrude come away the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse ho guildenstern   friends both go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain and from his mothers closet hath he draggd him go seek him out speak fair and bring the body into the chapel i pray you haste in this   come gertrude well call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and whats untimely done o come away my soul is full of discord and dismay i have sent to seek him and to find the body how dangerous is it that this man goes loose yet must not we put the strong law on him hes loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where tis so the offenders scourge is weighd but never the offence to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved or not at all   how now what hath befalln but where is he bring him before us now hamlet wheres polonius at supper where what dost you mean by this where is polonius ay hamlet so is it if thou knewst our purposes thy loving father hamlet follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard delay it not ill have him hence tonight away for every thing is seald and done that else leans on the affair pray you make haste   and england if my love thou holdst at aught as my great power thereof may give thee sense since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword and thy free awe pays homage to usthou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process which imports at full by letters congruing to that effect the present death of hamlet do it england for like the hectic in my blood he rages and thou must cure me till i know tis done howeer my haps my joys were neer begun how do you pretty lady conceit upon her father pretty ophelia how long hath she been thus follow her close give her good watch i pray you   o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her fathers death o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius death and we have done but greenly in huggermugger to inter him poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his fathers death wherein necessity of matter beggard will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear o my dear gertrude this like to a murderingpiece in many places gives me superfluous death where are my switzers let them guard the door   what is the matter the doors are broke who shall stay you why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman that i am guiltless of your fathers death and am most sensible in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment pierce as day does to your eye laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will and they shall hear and judge twixt you and me if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touchd we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we can ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labour with your soul to give it due content so you shall and where the offence is let the great axe fall i pray you go with me o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which shes so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timberd for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aimd them break not your sleeps for that you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more i loved your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine   how now what news from hamlet who brought them laertes you shall hear them leave us     high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing it falls right you have been talkd of since your travel much and that in hamlets hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege a very riband in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy ive seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as he had been incorpsed and deminatured with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with him now out of this laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returnd shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practise requite him for your father lets follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage now fear i this will give it start again therefore lets follow o he is mad laertes i pray you good horatio wait upon him     strengthen your patience in our last nights speech well put the matter to the present push good gertrude set some watch over your son this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet shortly shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be our son shall win aside  it is the poisond cup it is too late i do not thinktmy dread lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon my necessaries are embarkd farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighd his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalued persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmasterd importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft

cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratchd withal ill touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death drownd o where alas then she is drownd too much of water hast thou poor ophelia and therefore i forbid my tears but yet it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say

be done lay her i the earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring i tell thee churlish priest a ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling o treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprived thee of hold off the earth awhile till i have caught her once more in mine arms   now pile your dust upon the quick and dead till of this flat a mountain you have made to oertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus the devil take thy soul i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honour i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored but till that time i do receive your offerd love like love and will not wrong it come one for me you mock me sir this is too heavy let me see another come my lord no well again a touch a touch i do confess my

hamlet hamlet thou art slain no medicine in the world can do thee good in thee there is not half an hour of life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand unbated and envenomd the foul practise hath turnd itself on me lo here i lie never to rise again thy mothers poisond i can no more the king the kings to blame he is justly served it is a poison temperd by himself exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet mine and my fathers death come not upon thee nor thine on mehe hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seald my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayd for there my blessing with thee and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each newhatchd unfledged comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in beart that the opposed may beware of thee give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine ownself be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee the time invites you go your servants tend what ist ophelia be hath said to you marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them marry ill teach you think yourself a baby that you have taen these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thusyoull tender me a fool ay fashion you may call it go to go to ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is amaking you must not take for fire from this time be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look tot i charge you come your ways give him this money and these notes reynaldo marry well said very well said look you sir inquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him  do you mark this reynaldo and in part him but you may say not well but ift be he i mean hes very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault marry sir heres my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soild i the working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assured he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country with what i the name of god mad for thy love what said he come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late have i my lord i assure my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do that i have found the very cause of hamlets lunacy give first admittance to the ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what ist but to be nothing else but mad but let that go madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughterhave while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise   to the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified ophelia thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear thus   in her excellent white bosom these  c good madam stay

my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told mewhat might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had playd the desk or tablebook or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or lookd upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulseda short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for hath there been such a timeid fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it proved otherwise you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby at such a time ill loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason falln thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters away i do beseech you both away ill board him presently     o give me leave how

according to their desert i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and ill be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think and the queen too and that presently to king claudius  o ho do you mark that my lord the queen would speak with you and presently by the mass and tis like a camel indeed it is backed like a weasel i will say so behind  o i am slainaside  a little more than kin and less than kind not so my lord i am too much i the sun ay madam it is common seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits

excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followd my poor fathers body like niobe all tearswhy she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mournd longermarried with my uncle my fathers brother but no more like my father than i

very cold what hour now no it is struck the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge ay marry ist but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honourd in the breach than the observance this heavyheaded revel east and west makes us traduced and taxd of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performd at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birthwherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the oergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much oerleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being natures livery or fortunes star their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of eale doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in

thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do it will not speak then i will follow it why what should be the fear i do not set my life in a pins fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again ill follow it it waves me still go on ill follow thee hold off your hands my fate cries out and makes each petty

between who slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward into my grave you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life these tedious old fools my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both nor the soles of her shoe then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet whats the news then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither denmarks a prison a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o the worst why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams a dream itself is but a shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we to the court for by my fay i cannot reason no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak why any thing but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no aside  nay then i have an eye of youif you love me hold not off i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of latebut wherefore i know notlost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort what players are they how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed how comes it do they grow rusty what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common playersas it is most like if their means are no bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ist possible do the boys carry it away it is not very strange for mine uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty an hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my

judgments in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like the hyrcanian beast it is not soit begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeard with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their lords murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus oersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you it shall to the barbers with your beard prithee say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba the mobled queen tis well ill have thee speak out the rest soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph

are welcome to elsinore ay so god be wi ye   now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wannd tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddymettled rascal peak like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damnd defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murderd prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall acursing like a very drab a scullion fie upont foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimd their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ ill have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle ill observe his looks ill tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me ill have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein ill catch the conscience of the king to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wishd to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the pangs of despised love the laws delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscoverd country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of actionsoft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins rememberd i humbly thank you well well well no not i i never gave you aught ha ha are you honest are you fair that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery wheres your father let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool no where but ins own house farewell if thou dost marry ill give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell i have heard of your paintings too well enough god has given you one face and you make yourselves another you jig you amble and you lisp and nickname gods creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance go to ill no more ont it hath made me mad i say we will have no more marriages those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are to a nunnery go speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the towncrier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special oerstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready     how now my lord i will the king hear this piece of work bid the players make haste   will you two help to hasten them what ho horatio horatio thou art een as just a man as eer my conversation coped withal nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from

sound what stop she please give me that man that is not passions slave and i will wear him in my hearts core ay in my heart of heart as i do theesomething too much of this there is a play tonight before the king one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my fathers death i prithee when thou seest that act afoot even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damned ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcans stithy give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming they are coming to the play i must be idle get you a place excellent i faith of the chameleons dish i eat the air

not brassd it so that it is proof and bulwark against sense such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there makes marriagevows as false as dicers oaths o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heavens face doth glow yea this solidity and compound mass with tristful visage as against the doom is thoughtsick at the act look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperions curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury newlighted on a heavenkissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband look you now what follows here is your husband like a mildewd ear blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor ha have you eyes you cannot call it love for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame its humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplexd for madness would not err nor sense

flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed stewd in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket a king of shreds and patches   save me and hover oer me with your wings you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure do you not come your tardy son to chide that lapsed in time and passion lets go by the important acting of your dread command o say how is it with you lady on him on him look you how pale he glares his form and cause conjoind preaching to stones would make them capable do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects

look where he goes even now out at the portal ecstasy my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music it is not madness that i have utterd bring me to the test and i the matter will reword which madness would gambol from mother for love of grace lay not that mattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whilst rank corruption mining all within infects unseen confess yourself to heaven repent whats past avoid what is to come and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg yea curb and woo for leave to do him good o throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half good night but go not to mine uncles bed assume a virtue if you have it not that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits devil is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence the next more easy for use almost can change the stamp of nature and either           the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency once more good night and when you are desirous to be blessd ill blessing beg of you for this same lord   i do repent but heaven hath pleased it so to punish me with this and this with me that i must be their scourge and minister i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him so again good

the basket on the houses top let the birds fly and like the famous ape to try conclusions in the basket creep and break your own neck down i must to england you know that theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows whom i will trust as i will adders fangd they bear the mandate they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery let it work for tis the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon o tis most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet this man shall set me packing ill lug the guts into the neighbour room mother good night indeed this counsellor is now most still most secret and most grave who was in life a foolish prating knave come sir to draw toward an end with you good night mother safely stowed what noise who calls on hamlet o here they come compounded it with dust whereto tis kin do not believe it that i can keep your counsel and not mine own besides to be demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king ay sir that soaks up the kings countenance his rewards his authorities but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again i am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear the body is with the king but the king is not with the body the king is a thing of nothing bring me to him hide fox and all after at supper not where he eats but where he is eaten a certain convocation of politic worms are een at him your worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table thats the end a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar in heaven send hither to see if your messenger find him not there seek him i the other place yourself but indeed if you find him not

of poland sir or for some frontier why then the polack never will defend it two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw this is the imposthume of much wealth and peace that inward breaks and shows no cause without why the man dies i humbly thank you sir ill be with you straight go a little before   how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused now whether it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on the event a thought which quarterd hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward i do not know why yet i live to say this things to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to dot examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puffd makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honours at the stake how stand i then that have a father killd a mother staind excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain o from this time forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at gravemaking tis een so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were cains jawbone that did the first murder it might be the pate of a politician which this ass now oerreaches one that would circumvent god might it not or of a courtier which could say good morrow sweet lord how dost thou good lord this might be my lord suchaone that praised my lord suchaones horse when he meant to beg it might it not why een so and now my lady worms chapless and knocked about the mazzard with a sextons spade heres fine revolution an we had the trick to seet did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggats with em mine ache to think ont theres another why may not that be the skull of a lawyer where be his quiddities now his quillets his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery hum this fellow might be ins time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures the very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha is not parchment made of sheepskins they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that i will speak to this fellow whose graves this sirrah i think it be thine indeed for thou liest int thou dost lie int to be int and say it is thine tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest what man dost thou dig it for what woman then who is to be buried int how absolute the knave is we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us by the lord horatio these three years i have taken a note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he gaffs his kibe how long hast thou been a gravemaker how long is that since ay marry why was he sent into england why how came he mad how strangely upon what ground how long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot why he more than another whose was it nay i know not this let me see   alas poor yorick i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rims at it here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft where be your gibes now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar not one now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen now get you to my ladys chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come make her laugh at that prithee horatio tell me one thing dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i the earth and smelt so pah to what base uses we may return horatio why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole no faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel imperious caesar dead and turnd to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw but soft but soft aside here comes the king   the queen the courtiers who is this they follow and with such maimed rites this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo its own life twas of some estate couch we awhile and mark that is laertes a very noble youth mark what the fair ophelia advancing     what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand like wonderwounded hearers this is i hamlet the dane thou prayst not well i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenitive and rash yet have i something in me dangerous which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum what wilt thou do for her swounds show me what thoult do woot weep woot fight woot fast woot tear thyself woot drink up eisel eat a crocodile ill dot dost thou come here to whine to outface me with leaping in her grave be buried quick with her and so will i and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart nay an thoult mouth ill rant as well as thou hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometimes serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us theres a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will up from my cabin my seagown scarfd about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unseal their grand commission where i found horatio o royal knaveryan exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmarks health and englands too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the axe my head should be struck off heres the commission read it at more leisure but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed being thus benetted round with villanies ere i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the playi sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labourd much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeomans service wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many suchlike ases of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shrivingtime allowd why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my fathers signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in form of the other subscribed it gavet the impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our seafight and what to this was sequent thou knowst already why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon he that hath killd my king and whored my mother poppd in between the election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenageist not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and ist not to be damnd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil it will be short the interim is mine and a mans lifes no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his ill court his favours but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion i beseech you remember sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath what imports the nomination of this gentleman of him sir i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself whats his weapon thats two of his weapons but well what call you the carriages the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberalconceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish why is this imponed as you call it how if i answer no sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will yours yours   he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else fors turn he did comply with his dug before he sucked it thus has heand many more of the same bevy that i know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out i am constant to my purpose they follow the kings pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now in happy time she well instructs me i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practise i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves what ist to leave betimes give me your pardon sir ive done you wrong but pardont as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punishd with sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honour and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness wast hamlet wrongd laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be taen away and when hes not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness ift be so hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd his madness is poor hamlets enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot mine arrow oer the house and hurt my brother i embrace it freely and will this brothers wager frankly play give us the foils come on ill be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i the darkest night stick fiery off indeed

in his lawless fit behind the arras hearing something stir whips out his rapier cries a rat a rat and in this brainish apprehension kills the unseen good old man to draw apart the body he hath killd oer whom his very madness like some ore among a mineral of metals base shows itself pure he weeps for what is done i will not speak with her let her come in   to my sick soul as sins true nature is each toy seems prologue to some great amiss so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt how now ophelia alas sweet lady what imports this song how cheerfully on the

to speak of horrorshe comes before me my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus oer his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayd he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turnd he seemd to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his fetters and denied his access to me madam i wish it may good my lord how does your honour for this many a day my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to redeliver i pray you now receive them my honourd lord you know right well you did and with them words of so

flames must render up myself pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear i am thy fathers spirit doomd for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love revenge his foul and most unnatural murder murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abused but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy fathers life now wears his crown ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seducewon to his shameful lust the will of my most seemingvirtuous queen o hamlet what a fallingoff was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be moved though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel linkd will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter barkd about most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brothers hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhouseld disappointed unaneld no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible o horrible most horrible if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest but howsoever thou pursuest this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her fare thee well at once the glowworm shows the matin to be near and gins to pale his uneffectual fire adieu adieu hamlet remember me beneath  swear beneath  swear beneath  swear beneath  swear do not forget this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose but look amazement on thy mother sits o step between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works speak to her hamleti will my lord my lord i did intend it ay very well my lord as gaming my lord my lord that would dishonour him but my good lord ay my lord i would know that very good my lord at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman my lord i have good my lord i shall my lord well my lordyou

then sir does he thishe doeswhat was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such or such and as you say there was a gaming there oertook ins rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not god be wi you fare you well observe his inclination in yourself and let him ply his music farewell     how now ophelia whats the matter that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love the ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully returnd what do you think of me pointing to his head and shoulder take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre do you know me my lord what is the matter my lord i mean the matter that you read my lord indeed that is out o the air   how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughtermy honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you well be with you gentlemen my lord i have news to tell you the actors are come hither my lord thats good mobled queen is good come sirs tis most true and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves   read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much provedthat with devotions visage and pious action we do sugar oer the devil himself that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor i did enact julius caesar i was killed i the capitol brutus killed me give oer the play very like a whale my lord hes going to his mothers closet behind the arras ill convey myself to hear the process and warrant shell tax him home and as you said and wisely was it said tis meet that some more audience than a mother since nature makes them partial should oerhear the speech of vantage fare you well my liege ill call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know he will come straight look you lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with and that your grace hath screend and stood between much heat and him ill sconce me even here pray you be round with him behind  what ho help help helpgood gentlemen he hath much talkd of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a kings remembrance more matter with less art but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading have you forgot me o me what hast thou done alas hes mad this the very coinage of your brain this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in what shall i do bestow this place on us a little while   ah my good lord what have i seen tonight what would she have nay but ophelia alas look here my lord alack what noise is this calmly good laertes there is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream there with fantastic garlands did she come of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name but our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide and mermaidlike awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old tunes as one incapable of her own distress or like a creature native and indued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments heavy with their drink pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death hamlet hamlet hes fat and scant of breath here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows the queen carouses to thy fortune hamletboth your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty to polonius  god save you sir my most dear lord as the indifferent children of the earth neither my lord none my lord but that the worlds grown honest then is the world one we think not so my lord why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow to visit you my lord no other occasion to what end my lord aside to guildenstern  what say you my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service even those you were wont to take delight in the tragedians of the city i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation no indeed are they not nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aery of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too happily hes the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child good my lord he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak most like a gentleman niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply madam it so fell out that certain players we oerraught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him we shall my lord ay my lord they stay upon your patience then thus she says your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed my lord you once did love me good my lord what is your cause of distemper you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend how can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from noyance but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many the cease of majesty dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw whats near it with it it is a massy wheel fixd on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortised and adjoind which when it falls each small annexment petty consequence attends the boisterous ruin never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan what have you done my lord with the dead body tell us where tis that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel believe what take you me for a sponge my lord i understand you not my lord my lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king where the dead body is bestowd my lord we cannot get from him without my lord guarded to know your pleasure ho guildenstern bring in my lord wilt please you go my lordbut we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded heavens make our presence and our practises pleasant and helpful to him my honoured lord happy in that we are not overhappy on fortunes cap we are not the very button faith her privates we prison my lord which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream well wait upon you what should we say my lord my lord we were sent for o there has been much throwing about of brains there are the players in what my dear lord nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state but with much forcing of his disposition we will my lord good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you the king sir is in his retirement marvellous distempered no my lord rather with choler good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair the queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer i will do your mothers commandment if not your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business what my lord o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly my lord i cannot believe me i cannot i know no touch of it my lord but these cannot i command to any utterance of harmony i have not the skill we will ourselves provide most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty we will haste us within  hamlet lord hamlet a thing my lordwhat speech my lordanon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matchd pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemd i the air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new awork and never did the cyclops hammers fall on marss armour forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends but who o who had seen the mobled queen run barefoot up and down threatening the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all oerteemed loins a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd gainst fortunes state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods ay my lord ay my lord i warrant your honour i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sirfor us and for our tragedy here stooping to your clemency we beg your hearing patientlyfull thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round neptunes salt wash and tellus orbed ground and thirty dozen moons with borrowd sheen about the world have times twelve thirties been since love our hearts and hymen did our hands unite commutual in most sacred bands faith i must leave thee love and shortly too my operant powers their functions leave to do and thou shalt live in this fair world behind honourd beloved and haply one as kind for husband shalt thou i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanced makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own so think thou wilt no second husband wed but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead tis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhile my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile the tedious day with sleepso many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count oer ere love be done but woe is me you are so sick of late so far from cheer and from your former state that i distrust you yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must for womens fear and love holds quantity in neither aught or in extremity now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is sized my fear is so where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there o confound the rest such love must needs be treason in my breast in second husband let me be accurst none wed the second but who killd the first the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed nor earth to me give food nor heaven light sport and repose lock from me day and night to desperation turn my trust and hope an anchors cheer in prison be my scope each opposite that blanks the face of joy meet what i would have well and it destroy both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife sleep rock thy brain and never come mischance between us twainthoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing confederate season else no creature seeing thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected with hecates ban thrice blasted thrice infected thy natural magic and dire property on wholesome life usurp immediatelygo captain from me greet the danish king tell him that by his licence fortinbras craves the conveyance of a promised march over his kingdom you know the rendezvous if that his majesty would aught with us we shall express our duty in his eye and let him know so where is this sight let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royally and for his passage the soldiers music and the rites of war speak loudly for him take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss go bid the soldiers shooti will dot my lord they are of norway sir against some part of poland the nephews to old norway fortinbras truly to speak and with no addition we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name to pay five ducats five i

hearers to collection they aim at it and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them indeed would make one think there might be thought though nothing sure yet much unhappily save yourself my lord the ocean overpeering of his list eats not the flats with more impetuous haste than young laertes in a riotous head oerbears your officers the
