tush never tell me i take it much unkindly that thou iago who hast had my purse as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate by heaven i rather would have been his hangman i would not follow him then what a full fortune does the thicklips owe if he can carryt thus here is her fathers house ill call aloud what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho signior is all your family within most reverend signior do you know my voice my name is roderigo sir sir sir patience good sir most grave brabantio in simple and pure soul i come to you sir i will answer any thing but i beseech you ift be your pleasure and most wise consent as partly i find it is that your fair daughter at this oddeven and dull watch o the night transported with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire a gondolier to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor if this be known to you and your allowance we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke do not believe that from the sense of all civility i thus would play and trifle with your reverence your daughter if you have not given her leave i say again hath made a gross revolt tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and every where straight satisfy yourself if she be in her chamber or your house let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you truly i think they are yes sir i have indeed i think i can discover him if you please to get good guard and go along with me signior it is the moor iago what will i do thinkest thou i will incontinently drown myself it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it it cannot be wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue where shall we meet i the morning ill be with thee betimes what say you i am changed ill go sell all my land with him why tis not possible i cannot believe that in her shes full of most blessed condition yes that i did but that was but courtesy well i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity adieu beat me i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry my money is almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice i do not find that thou dealest justly with me every day thou daffest me with some device iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope i will indeed no longer endure it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered faith i have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin together with nought but truth i have wasted myself out of my means the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but i find none very well go to i cannot go to man nor tis not very well nay i think it is scurvy and begin to find myself fobbed in it i tell you tis not very well i will make myself known to desdemona if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing it hath not appeared well what is it is it within reason and compass is that true why then othello and desdemona return again to venice how do you mean removing of him and that you would have me to do i will hear further reason for this be near at hand i may miscarry int i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons tis but a man gone forth my sword he dies i know his gait tis hevillain thou diest o i am slain o villain that i am o wretched villain nobody come then shall i bleed to death o help me here o damnd iago o inhuman dogsblood but you will not hear me if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me despise me if i do not three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant offcappd to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuffd with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for certes says he i have already chose my officer and what was he forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practise is all his soldiership but he sir had the election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christian and heathen must be beleed and calmd by debitor and creditor this countercaster he in good time must his lieutenant be and igod bless the markhis moorships ancient why theres no remedy tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to the first now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor o sir content you i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly followd you shall mark many a duteous and kneecrooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his masters ass for nought but provender and when hes old cashierd whip me such honest knaves others there are who trimmd in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such changes of vexation ont as it may lose some colour do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves thieves look to your house your daughter and your bags thieves thieves are your doors lockd zounds sir youre robbd for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is topping your white ewe arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians youll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse youll have your nephews neigh to you youll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs you area senator farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be producedas if i stay i shall against the moor for i do know the state however this may gall him with some cheque cannot with safety cast him for hes embarkd with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stand in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business in which regard though i do hate him as i do hellpains yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love which is indeed but sign that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the raised search and there will i be with him so farewell though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o the conscience to do no contrived murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought to have yerkd him here under the ribs nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honour that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him but i pray you sir are you fast married be assured of this that the magnifico is much beloved and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the dukes he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law with all his might to enforce it on will give him cable those are the raised father and his friends you were best go in by janus i think no faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack if it prove lawful prize hes made for ever hes married marry tocome captain will you go it is brabantio general be advised he comes to bad intent you roderigo come sir i am for you what sayst thou noble heart why go to bed and sleep if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guineahen i would change my humanity with a baboon virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind puppies i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy pursenor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse these moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with moneythe food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her thou art sure of mego make moneyi have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this tomorrow adieu at my lodging go to farewell do you hear roderigo no more of drowning do you hear thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gaind knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets he has done my office i know not ift be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him cassios a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knaveryhow how lets see after some time to abuse othellos ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framed to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are i havet it is engenderd hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me youll have enough in faith too much i find it still when i have list to sleep marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking come on come on you are pictures out of doors bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens saints m your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds nay it is true or else i am a turk you rise to play and go to bed to work no let me not o gentle lady do not put me tot for i am nothing if not critical ay madam i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliverd if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the ones for use the other useth it if she be black and thereto have a wit shell find a white that shall her blackness fit she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly helpd her to an heir theres none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lackd gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said now i may she that being angerd her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cods head for the salmons tail she that could think and neer disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were to suckle fools and chronicle small beer aside  he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own courtship you say true tis so indeed if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in very good well kissed an excellent courtesy tis so indeed yet again your fingers to your lips would they were clysterpipes for your sake   the moor i know his trumpet aside  o you are well tuned now but ill set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am do thou meet me presently at the harbour come hither if thou best valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to themlist me the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guardfirst i must tell thee thisdesdemona is directly in love with him lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies and will she love him still for prating let not thy discreet heart think it her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this grantedas it is a most pregnant and unforced positionwho stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already blessed figsend the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor blessed pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand didst not mark that lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts they met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together villanous thoughts roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion pish but sir be you ruled by me i have brought you from venice watch you tonight for the command ill layt upon you cassio knows you not ill not be far from you do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity i warrant thee meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore farewell that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think hell prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leapd into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evend with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putting on ill have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my nightcap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practising upon his peace and quiet even to madness tis here but yet confused knaverys plain face is never seen tin used not this hour lieutenant tis not yet ten o the clock our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove and ill warrant her fun of game what an eye she has methinks it sounds a parley of provocation and when she speaks is it not an alarum to love well happiness to their sheets come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello o they are our friends but one cup ill drink for you what man tis a night of revels the gallants desire it here at the door i pray you call them in if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already hell be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress dog now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turnd almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight caroused potations pottledeep and hes to watch three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honours in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight flusterd with flowing cups and they watch too now mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the islebut here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream some wine ho   and let me the canakin clink clink and let me the canakin clink a soldiers a man a lifes but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swagbellied hollanderdrink hoare nothing to your english why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled o sweet england king stephen was a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he calld the tailor lown he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree tis pride that pulls the country down then take thine auld cloak about thee some wine ho will you heart again its true good lieutenant and so do i too lieutenant you see this fellow that is gone before he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar and give direction and do but see his vice tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as the other tis pity of him i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island tis evermore the prologue to his sleep hell watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle aside to him  how now roderigo i pray you after the lieutenant go not i for this fair island i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evilbut hark what noise aside to roderigo  away i say go out and cry a mutiny   nay good lieutenantalas gentlemen help holieutenantsirmontanosir help mastersheres a goodly watch indeed   whos that which rings the belldiablo ho the town will rise gods will lieutenant hold you will be shamed for ever hold ho lieutenantsirmontanogentlemen have you forgot all sense of place and duty hold the general speaks to you hold hold for shame i do not know friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at others breast in opposition bloody i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it touch me not so near i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determined sword to execute upon him sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamouras it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i returnd the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i neer might say before when i came back for this was briefi found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass what are you hurt lieutenant marry heaven forbid as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and hes yours what was he that you followed with your sword what had he done to you ist possible why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered come you are too severe a moraler as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you you or any man living may be drunk at a time man ill tell you what you shall do our generals wife is now the general may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago and whats he then that says i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit shes framed as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moorweret to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetterd to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortunes and she for him pleads strongly to the moor ill pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her bodys lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all   how now roderigo how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time doest not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashierd cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short retire thee go where thou art billeted away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone   two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress ill set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife ay thats the way dull not device by coldness and delay you have not been abed then ill send her to you presently and ill devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free well my good lord ill dot ha i like not that nothing my lord or ifi know not what cassio my lord no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guiltylike seeing you coming my noble lord did michael cassio when you wood my lady know of your love but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harm i did not think he had been acquainted with her indeed honest my lord my lord for aught i know think my lord my lord you know i love you for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none why then i think cassios an honest man good my lord pardon me though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false as wheres that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and lawdays and in session sit with meditations lawful i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my natures plague to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom yet from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst tis in my custody o beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he oer who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me i speak not yet of proof look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure i would not have your free and noble nature out of selfbounty be abused look tot i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands their best conscience is not to leavet undone but keept unknown she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seemd to shake and fear your looks she loved them most why go to then she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her fathers eyes up close as oak he thought twas witchcraftbut i am much to blame i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you i see this hath a little dashd your spirits i faith i fear it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love but i do see youre moved i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success as my thoughts aim not at cassios my worthy friend my lord i see youre moved long live she so and long live you to think so ay theres the point asto be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends foh one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgment may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent going  my lord i take my leave returning  my lord i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that in the mean time let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free i do beseech your honour i once more take my leave how now what do you here alone a thing for me it is a common thing to have a foolish wife what handkerchief hast stoln it from her a good wench give it me snatching it  why whats that to you be not acknown on t i have use for it go leave me   i will in cassios lodging lose this napkin and let him find it trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ this may do something the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulphur i did say so look where he comes   not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owedst yesterday why how now general no more of that how now my lord i am sorry to hear this ist possible my lord ist come to this my noble lord o grace o heaven forgive me are you a man have you a soul or sense god be wi you take mine office o wretched fool that livest to make thine honesty a vice o monstrous world take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe i thank you for this profit and from hence ill love no friend sith love breeds such offence i should be wise for honestys a fool and loses that it works for i see sir you are eaten up with passion i do repent me that i put it to you you would be satisfied and may but how how satisfied my lord would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her toppd it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own what then how then what shall i say wheres satisfaction it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you may havet i do not like the office but sith i am enterd in this cause so far prickd tot by foolish honesty and love i will go on i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard as if he pluckd up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor nay this was but his dream and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly nay but be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand i know not that but such a handkerchief i am sure it was your wifesdid i today see cassio wipe his beard with if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs yet be content patience i say your mind perhaps may change do not rise yet   witness you everburning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wrongd othellos service let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever my friend is dead tis done at your request but let her live i am your own for ever there is no other way tis she must dot and lo the happiness go and importune her is my lord angry can he be

deserve your pains down with him thief o thou foul thief where hast thou stowd my daughter damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her for ill refer me to all things of sense if she in chains of magic were not bound whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she shunned the wealthy curled darlings of our nation would ever have to incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight judge me the world if tis not gross in sense that thou hast practised on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion ill havet disputed on tis probable and palpable to thinking i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer how the duke in council in this time of the night bring him away mines not an idle cause the duke himself or any of my brothers of the state cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own for if such actions may have passage free bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be so did i yours good your grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so floodgate and oerbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself my daughter o my daughter ay to me she is abused stoln from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so preposterously to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not humbly i thank your grace here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the stateaffairs hath hither brought nothing but this is so a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushd at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit every thing to fall in love with what she feard to look on it is a judgment maimd and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practises of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful oer the blood or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience god be wi you i have done please it your grace on to the stateaffairs i had rather to adopt a child than get it come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state ill not have it so look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may theetis better as it is let him do his spite my services which i have done the signiory shall outtongue his complaints tis yet to know which when i know that boasting is an honour i shall promulgatei fetch my life and being from men of royal siege and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that i have reachd for know iago but that i love the gentle desdemona i would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the seas worth but look what lights come yond not ii must be found my parts my title and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly is it they the servants of the duke and my lieutenant the goodness of the night upon you friends what is the news what is the matter think you tis well i am found by you i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you have with you holla stand there keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them good signior you shall more command with years than with your weapons hold your hands both you of my inclining and the rest were it my cue to fight i should have known it without a prompter where will you that i go to answer this your charge what if i do obey how may the duke be therewith satisfied whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him most potent grave and reverend signiors my very noble and approved good masters that i have taen away this old mans daughter it is most true true i have married her the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech and little blessd with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years pith till now some nine moons wasted they have used their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnishd tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and let her speak of me before her father if you do find me foul in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not only take away but let your sentence even fall upon my life ancient conduct them you best know the place   and till she come as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears ill present how i did thrive in this fair ladys love and she in mine her father loved me oft invited me still questiond me the story of my life from year to year the battles sieges fortunes that i have passed i ran it through even from my boyish days to the very moment that he bade me tell it wherein i spake of most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and field of hairbreadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slavery of my redemption thence and portance in my travels history wherein of antres vast and deserts idle rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven it was my hint to speaksuch was the process and of the cannibals that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the houseaffairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch sheld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth sufferd my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful she wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd that heaven had made her such a man she thankd me and bade me if i had a friend that loved her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she loved me for the dangers i had passd and i loved her that she did pity them this only is the witchcraft i have used here comes the lady let her witness it the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thricedriven bed of down i do agnise a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit disposition for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding nor i let her have your voices vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heatthe young affects in me defunctand proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me no when lightwingd toys of featherd cupid seal with wanton dullness my speculative and officed instruments that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation with all my heart so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honest and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife with what else needful your good grace

after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have wakend death and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympushigh and duck again as low as hells from heaven if it were now to die twere now to be most happy for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate amen to that sweet powers i cannot speak enough of this

straight excellent wretch perdition catch my soul but i do love thee and when i love thee not chaos is come again what dost thou say iago he did from first to last why dost thou ask why of thy thought iago o yes and went between us very oft indeed ay indeed discernst thou aught in that is he not honest honest ay honest what dost thou think think my lord by heaven he echoes me as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown thou dost mean something i heard thee say even now thou likedst not that when cassio left my wife what didst not like and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought i think thou dost and for i know thourt full of love and honesty and weighst thy words before thou givest them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man thats just they are close delations working from the heart that passion cannot rule i think so too certain men should be what they seem nay yet theres more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but thinkst him wrongd and makest his ear a stranger to thy thoughts what dost thou mean by heaven ill know thy thoughts ha o misery why why is this thinkst thou ild make a lie of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago ill see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy dost thou say so and so she did i am bound to thee for ever not a jot not a jot i will not no not much moved i do not think but desdemonas honest and yet how nature erring from itself farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe leave me iago why did i marry this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds fear not my government this fellows of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings ild whistle her off and let her down the wind to pray at fortune haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declined into the vale of yearsyet thats not much shes gone i am abused and my relief must be to loathe her o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others uses yet tis the plague of great ones prerogatived are they less than the base tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken desdemona comes   if she be false o then heaven mocks itself ill not believet i am to blame i have a pain upon my forehead here your napkin is too little   let it alone come ill go in with you ha ha false to me avaunt be gone thou hast set me on the rack i swear tis better to be much abused than but to knowt a little what sense had i of her stoln hours of lust i sawt not thought it not it harmd not me i slept the next night well was free and merry i found not cassios kisses on her lips he that is robbd not wanting what is stoln let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind farewell content farewell the plumed troop and the big wars that make ambition virtue o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and o you mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal joves dead clamours counterfeit farewell othellos occupations gone villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it give me the ocular proof or by the worth of mans eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my waked wrath make me to seet or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more abandon all remorse on horrors head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that nay stay thou shouldst be honest by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not i think that thou art just and think thou art not ill have some proof her name that was as fresh as dians visage is now begrimed and black as mine own face if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams ill not endure it would i were satisfied would nay i will death and damnation o give me a living reason shes disloyal o monstrous monstrous but this denoted a foregone conclusion tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream ill tear her all to pieces i gave her such a one twas my first gift if it be that o that the slave had forty thousand lives one is too poor too weak for my revenge now do i see tis true look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven tis gone arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught for tis of aspics tongues o blood blood blood never iago like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up now by yond marble heaven   in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee tot within these three days let me hear thee say that cassios not alive damn her lewd minx o damn her come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil now art thou

you uncle there lies your niece whose breath indeed these hands have newly stoppd i know this act shows horrible and grim tis pitiful but yet iago knows that she with cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed cassio confessd it and she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which i first gave her i saw it in his hand it was a handkerchief an antique token my father gave my mother are there no stones in heaven but what serve for the thunderprecious villain i am not valiant neither but ever puny whipster gets my sword but why should honour outlive honesty let it go all i have another weapon in this chamber it is a sword of spain the icebrooks temper o here it is uncle i must come forth look in upon me then and speak with me or naked as i am i will assault thee behold i have a weapon a better never did itself sustain upon a soldiers thigh i have seen the day that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop but o vain boast who can control his fate tis not so now be not afraid though you do see me weapond here is my journeys end here is my butt and very seamark of my utmost sail do you go back dismayd tis a lost fear man but a rush against othellos breast and he retires where should othello go now how dost thou look now o illstarrd wench pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven and fiends will snatch at it cold cold my girl even like thy chastity o cursed slave whip me ye devils from the possession of this heavenly sight blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire o desdemona desdemona dead oh oh oh thats he that was othello here i am i look down towards his feet but thats a fable if that thou best a devil i cannot kill thee i am not sorry neither ild have thee live for in my sense tis happiness to die why any thing an honourable murderer if you will for nought i did in hate but all in honour ay i do believe it and i ask your pardon will you i pray demand that demidevil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body well thou dost best o villain o the pernicious caitiff how came you cassio by that handkerchief that was my wifes o fool fool fool soft you a word or two before you go i have done the state some service and they knowt no more of that i pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate speak of me as i am nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but being wrought perplexd in the extreme of one whose hand like the base indian threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes albeit unused to the melting mood drop tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gum set you down this and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turband turk beat a venetian and traduced the state i took by the throat the circumcised dog and smote him thus i kissd thee ere i killd thee no way but this killing myself to die upon a kissthe duke does greet you general and he requires your hasteposthaste appearance even on the instant something from cyprus as i may divine it is a business of some heat the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one anothers heels and many of the consuls raised and met are at the dukes already you have been hotly calld for when being not at your lodging to be found the senate hath sent about three several guests to search you out ancient what makes he here i do not understand to who here comes another troop to seek for you thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor o let the heavens give him defence against the elements for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea his bark is stoutly timberd his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes not surfeited to death stand in bold cure what noise my hopes do shape him for the governor i pray you sir go forth and give us truth who tis that is arrived most fortunately he hath achieved a maid that paragons description and wild fame one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener   how now who has put in has had most favourable and happy speed tempests themselves high seas and howling winds the gutterd rocks and congregated sands traitors ensteepd to clog the guiltless keel as having sense of beauty do omit their mortal natures letting go safely by the divine desdemona she that i spake of our great captains captain left in the conduct of the bold iago whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a sennights speed great jove othello guard and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath that he may bless this bay with his tall ship make loves quick pants in desdemonas arms give renewd fire to our extincted spirits and bring all cyprus comfort   o behold the riches of the ship is come on shore ye men of cyprus let her have your knees hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven before behind thee and on every hand enwheel thee round he is not yet arrived nor know i aught but that hes well and will be shortly here the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowshipbut hark a sail see for the news   good ancient you are welcome   welcome mistress let it not gall your patience good iago that i extend my manners tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy he speaks home madam you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar tis truly so lo where he comes iago hath direction what to do but notwithstanding with my personal eye will i look tot welcome iago we must to the watch shes a most exquisite lady indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest she is indeed perfection not tonight good iago i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment i have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more where are they ill dot but it dislikes me fore god they have given me a rouse already fore god an excellent song is your englishman so expert in his drinking to the health of our general why this is a more exquisite song than the other no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things well gods above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved for mine own partno offence to the general nor any man of qualityi hope to be saved ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient lets have no more of this lets to our affairsforgive us our sinsgentlemen lets look to our business do not think gentlemen i am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left i am not drunk now i can stand well enough and speak well enough why very well then you must not think then that i am drunk you rogue you rascal a knave teach me my duty ill beat the knave into a twiggen bottle dost thou prate rogue let me go sir or ill knock you oer the mazzard drunk i pray you pardon me i cannot speak ay past all surgery reputation reputation reputation o i have lost my reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial my reputation iago my reputation i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with ones own shadow o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil i know not i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil i have well approved it sir i drunk you advise me well i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here masters play here i will content your pains something thats brief and bid good morrow general dost thou hear my honest friend prithee keep up thy quillets theres a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring

to your wife my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access i humbly thank you fort   i never knew a florentine more kind and honest yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone i am much bound to you bounteous madam whatever shall become of michael cassio hes never any thing but your true servant ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service madam ill take my leave madam not now i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes madam my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honour i would not be delayd if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrows nor purposed merit in futurity can ransom me into his love again but to know so must be my benefit so shall i clothe me in a forced content and shut myself up in some other course to fortunes alms i humbly thank your ladyship what make you from home how is it with you my most fair bianca i faith sweet love i was coming to your house pardon me bianca i have this while with leaden thoughts been pressd but i shall in

marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise she was here even now she haunts me in every place i was the other day talking on the seabank with certain venetians and thither comes the bauble and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me ha ha ha well i must leave her company tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one   what do you mean by this haunting of me how now my sweet bianca how now how now faith i must shell rail in the street else faith i intend so prithee come will you that thrust had been mine enemy

world nor do i know the man dear general i never gave you cause most heathenish and most gross i found it in my chamber and he himself confessd but even now that there he droppd it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire there is besides in roderigos letter how he upbraids iago that he made him brave me upon the watch whereon it came that i was cast and even but now he spake after long seeming dead iago hurt him iago set him on this did i fear but thought he had no weapon for he was great of hearttis true most worthy signior the dukes in council and your noble self i am sure is sent for a messenger from the galleys here is more newsthere is no composition in these news that gives them credit and mine a hundred and forty nay in all confidence hes not for rhodes tis certain then for cyprus marcus luccicos is not he in town valiant othello we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman   i did not see you welcome gentle signior we lackd your counsel and your help tonight why whats the matter whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself and you of her the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense yea though our proper son stood in your action to othello  what in your own part can you say to this to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him fetch desdemona hither let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes the robbd that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition if you please bet at her fathers what would you desdemona let it be so good night to every one   and noble signior if virtue no delighted beauty lack your soninlaw is far more fair than blackindeed they are disproportiond my letters say a hundred and seven galleys this cannot be by no assay of reason tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dressd in if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless ay so i thought how many as you guess here comes brabantio and the valiant moor but othello speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maids affections or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth you must away tonight adieu brave moor use desdemona welland mine two hundred but though they jump not on a just account as in these cases where the aim reports tis oft with differenceyet do they all confirm a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprusnay it is possible enough to judgment i do not so secure me in the error but the main article i do approve in fearful sense now whats the businesswithin  what ho what ho what ho the turkish preparation makes for rhodes so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelohow say you by this change write from us to him postposthaste dispatch say it othello i think this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going the affair cries haste and speed must answer it at nine i the morning here well meet again othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import youthe ottomites reverend and gracious steering with due course towards the isle of rhodes have there injointed them with an after fleet of thirty sail and now they do restem their backward course bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus signior montano your trusty and most valiant servitor with his free duty recommends you thus and prays you to believe himhes now in florence dead we are very sorry fortmy noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learn me how to respect you you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but heres my husband and so much duty as my mother showd to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice to assist my simpleness that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my hearts subdued even to the very quality of my lord i saw othellos visage in his mind and to his honour and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence let me go with him i thank you valiant cassio what tidings can you tell me of my lord o but i fearhow lost you company alas she has no speech o fie upon thee slanderer what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me come on assay theres one gone to the harbour i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise come how wouldst thou praise me well praised how if she be black and witty worse and worse these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse what miserable praise hast thou for her thats foul and foolish o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself to do what o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband how say you cassio is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor lets meet him and receive him my dear othello the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow whats the matter be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf o thats an honest fellow do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were i knowt i thank you you do love my lord you have known him long and be you well assured he shall in strangeness stand no further off than in a polite distance do not doubt that before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place assure thee if i do vow a friendship ill perform it to the last article my lord shall never rest ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift ill intermingle every thing he does with cassios suit therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away why stay and hear me speak well do your discretion how now my lord i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure why your lieutenant cassio good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgment in an honest face i prithee call him back ay sooth so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him good love call him back but shallt be shortly shallt be tonight at supper tomorrow dinner then why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days in faith hes penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason save that they say the wars must make examples out of their bestis not almost a fault to incur a private cheque when shall he come tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mammering on what michael cassio that came awooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath taen your part to have so much to do to bring him in trust me i could do much why this is not a boon tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted shall i deny you no farewell my lord emilia come be as your fancies teach you whateer you be i am obedient how now my dear othello your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence why do you speak so faintly are you not well faith thats with watching twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well i am very sorry that you are not well do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies why man go to where lodges he can any thing be made of this can you inquire him out and be edified by report seek him bid him come hither tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well where should i lose that handkerchief emilia believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking who he i think the sun where he was born drew all such humours from him i will not leave him now till cassio be calld to him   how ist with you my lord well my good lord it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow you may indeed say so for twas that hand that gave away my heart i cannot speak of this come now your promise i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you here my lord i have it not about me no indeed my lord ist possible indeed ist true then would to god that i had never seent why do you speak so startingly and rash heaven bless us it is not lost but what an if it were i say it is not lost why so i can sir but i will not now this is a trick to put me from my suit pray you let cassio be received again come come youll never meet a more sufficient man i pray talk me of cassio a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shared dangers with you in sooth you are to blame i neer saw this before sure theres some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it how now good cassio whats the news with you alas thricegentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alterd so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech you must awhile be patient what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare let that suffice you i prithee do so   something sure of state either from venice or some unhatchd practise made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases mens natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object tis even so for let our finger ache and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had subornd the witness and hes indicted falsely alas the day i never gave him cause heaven keep that monster from othellos mind i will go seek

am for it lieutenant and ill do you justice to the platform masters come lets set the watch but is he often thus it were well the general were put in mind of it perhaps he sees it not or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils is not this true and tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor whats the matter lieutenant nay good lieutenant   i pray you sir hold your hand come come youre drunk zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can inform you while i spare speech which something now offends me of all that i do know nor know i aught by me thats said or done amiss this

no soldier what is the matter how now general o monstrous act tis a notorious villain take you this weapon which i have here recoverd from the moor come guard the door without let him not pass but kill him rather ill after that same villain for tis a damned slavenothing at all it is a highwrought flood i cannot twixt the heaven and the main descry a saila segregation of the turkish fleet for do but stand upon the foaming shore the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds the windshaked surge with high and monstrous mane seems to cast water on the burning bear and quench the guards of the everfixed pole i never did like molestation view on the enchafed flood i shall tis one iago ancient to the general they give their greeting to the citadel this likewise is a friendnews lads our wars are done the desperate tempest hath so bangd the turks that their designment halts a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet the ship is here put in a veronesa michael cassio lieutenant to the warlike moor othello is come on shore the moor himself at sea and is in full commission here for cyprus well wait upon your lordshipbut this same cassio though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly and prays the moor be safe for they were parted with foul and violent tempest come lets do so for every minute is expectancy of more arrivancethe town is empty on the brow o the sea stand ranks of people and they cry a sailthey do discharge their shot of courtesy our friends at leastyou have little cause to say so you shall not write my praise how if fair and foolish good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again pray you come in i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely good madam do i warrant it grieves my husband as if the case were his madam here comes my lord i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor my wayward husband hath a hundred times wood me to steal it but she so loves the token for he conjured her she should ever keep it that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to ill have the work taen out and givet iago what he will do with it heaven knows not i i nothing but to please his fantasy do not you chide i have a thing for you ha o is that all what will you give me now for the same handkerchief what handkerchief why that the moor first gave to desdemona that which so often you did bid me steal no faith she let it drop by negligence and to the advantage i being here tookt up look here it is what will you do with t that you have been so earnest to have me filch it if it be not for some purpose of import givet me again poor lady shell run mad when she shall lack it i know not madam is he not jealous look where he comes is not this man jealous tis not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs and we all but food to eat us hungerly and when they are full they belch us look you cassio and my husband he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness pray heaven it be statematters as you think and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you but jealous souls will not be answerd so they are not ever jealous for the cause but jealous for they are jealous tis a monster begot upon itself born on itself lady amen nor ever heard nor ever did suspect but then i saw no harm and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them never my lord never never my lord i durst my lord to wager she is honest lay down my soul at stake if you think other remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpents curse for if she be not honest chaste and true theres no man happy the purest of their wives is foul as slander alas what does this gentleman conceive how do you madam how do you my good lady good madam whats the matter with my lord why with my lord madam he that is yours sweet lady heres a change indeed alas iago my lord hath so bewhored her thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her as true hearts cannot bear he calld her whore a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callat hath she forsook so many noble matches her father and her country and her friends to be calld whore would it not make one weep i will be hangd if some eternal villain some busy and insinuating rogue some cogging cozening slave to get some office have not devised this slander ill be hangd else a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones why should he call her whore who keeps her company what place what time what form what likelihood the moors abused by some most villanous knave some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow o heaven that such companions thouldst unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west o fie upon them some such squire he was that turnd your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the moor how goes it now he looks gentler than he did dismiss me i would you had never seen him i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed come come you talk shall i go fetch your nightgown a very handsome man i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip its the wind tis neither here nor there there be some such no question why would not you nor i neither by this heavenly light i might dot as well i the dark the worlds a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice in troth i think i should and undot when i had done marry i would not do such a thing for a jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole worldwhy who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch i should venture purgatory fort why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and having the world for your labour tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for but i do think it is their husbands faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it that they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and doth affection breed it i think it doth ist frailty that thus errs it is so too and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so las whats the matter whats the matter husband alas good gentleman alas good cassio fie fie upon thee strumpet as i foh fie upon
