the like to fall it on gonzalo then let us both be sudden o twas a din to fright a monsters ear to make an earthquake sure it was the roar of a whole herd of lions aside to sebastian  i am right glad that hes so out of hope do not for one repulse forego the purpose that you resolved to effect aside to sebastian  let it be tonight for now they are oppressd with travel they will not nor cannot use

kings fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis not since widow didos time this tunis sir was carthage i assure you carthage ay sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we

thine ear obey and be attentive canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not out three years old by what by any other house or person of any thing the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance thou hadst and more miranda but how is it that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time if thou rememberst aught ere thou camest here how thou camest here thou mayst twelve year since miranda twelve year since thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter and thy father was duke of milan and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued both both my girl by foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence but blessedly holp hither my brother and thy uncle calld antonio i pray thee mark methat a brother should be so perfidioushe whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle dost thou attend me being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who to advance and who to trash for overtopping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed em or else new formd em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i the state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and suckd my verdure out ont thou attendst not i pray thee mark me i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired oerprized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing dost thou hear to have no screen between this part he playd and him he playd it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbowdalas poor milan to most ignoble stooping mark his condition and the event then tell me if this might be a brother now the condition the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit which was that he in lieu o the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self hear a little further and then ill bring thee to the present business which nows upons without the which this story were most impertinent well demanded wench my tale provokes that question dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colours fairer painted their foul ends in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat not riggd nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively had quit it there they hoist us to cry to the sea that roard to us to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deckd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groand which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnishd me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom now i arise   sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow here in

i have dispersed them bout the isle the kings son have i landed by himself whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting his arms in this sad knot safely in harbour is the kings ship in the deep nook where once thou calldst me up at midnight to fetch dew from the stillvexd bermoothes there shes hid the mariners all under hatches stowd who with a charm joind to their sufferd labour i have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet which i dispersed they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean flote bound sadly home for naples supposing that they saw

i shall be pinchd to death ay that i will and ill be wise hereafter and seek for grace what a thricedouble ass was i to take this drunkard for a god and worship this dull foolwhere should this music be i the air or the earth it sounds no more and sure it waits upon some god o the island sitting on a bank weeping again the king my fathers wreck this music crept by me upon the waters allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air thence i have followd it or it hath drawn me rather but tis gone no it begins again   full fathom five thy father lies of his bones are coral made those are pearls that were his eyes nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a seachange into something rich and strange seanymphs hourly ring his knell   hark now i hear themdingdong bell the ditty does remember my drownd father this is no mortal business nor no sound that the earth owes i hear it now above me most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my prayer may know if you remain upon this island and that you will some good instruction give how i may bear me here my prime request which i do last pronounce is o you wonder if you be maid or no my language heavens i am the best of them that speak this speech were i but where tis spoken a single thing as i am now that wonders to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me and that he does i weep myself am naples who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld the king my father wreckd yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan and his brave son being twain o if a virgin and your affection not gone forth ill make you the queen of naples no as i am a man no i will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power so they are my spirits as in a dream are all bound up my fathers loss the weakness which i feel the wreck of all my friends nor this mans threats to whom i am subdued are but light to me might i but through my prison once a day behold this maid all corners else o the earth let liberty make use of space enough have i in such a prison there be some sports are painful and their labour delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone and most poor matters point to rich ends this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious but the mistress which i serve quickens whats dead and makes my labours pleasures o she is ten times more gentle than her fathers crabbed and hes composed of harshness i must remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness had never like executor i forget but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours most busy lest when i do it o most dear mistress the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do no precious creature i had rather crack my sinews break my back than you should such dishonour undergo while i sit lazy by no noble mistresstis fresh morning with me when you are by at night i do beseech you chiefly that i might set it in my prayers what is your name admired miranda indeed the top of admiration worth whats dearest to the world full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent ear for several virtues have i liked several women never any with so fun soul but some defect in her did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed and put it to the foil but you o you so perfect and so peerless are created of every creatures best i am in my condition a prince miranda i do think a king i would not soand would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the fleshfly blow my mouth hear my soul speak the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service there resides to make me slave to it and for your sake am i this patient logman o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound and crown what i profess with kind event if i speak true if hollowly invert what best is boded me to mischief i beyond all limit of what else i the world do love prize honour you wherefore weep you my mistress dearest and i thus humble ever ay with a heart as willing as bondage eer of freedom heres my hand a thousand thousand i do believe it against an oracle as i hope for quiet days fair issue and long life with such love as tis now the murkiest den the most opportune place the strongst suggestion our worser genius can shall never melt mine honour into lust to take away the edge of that days celebration when i shall think or phoebus steeds are founderd or night kept chaind below i warrant you sir the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardour of my liver this is a most majestic vision and harmoniously charmingly may i be bold to think these spirits let me live here ever so rare a wonderd father and a wife makes this place paradise this is strange your fathers in some passion that works him strongly no my dearst love i would not for the world though the seas threaten they are merciful i have cursed them without cause sir she is mortal but by immortal providence shes mine i chose her when i could not ask my father for his advice nor thought i had one she is daughter to this famous duke of milan of whom so often i have heard renown but never saw before of whom i have received a second life and second father this lady makes him to methough this island seem to be desert uninhabitable and almost inaccessible yet it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance the air breathes upon us here most sweetly tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen widow dido said
